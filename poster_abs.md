Chip traps provide a robust, miniaturized environment for probing of ultracold atoms in high field gradients; with  coherent control from coupling hyperfine transitions to microwaves propagating through on-chip microwave guides. A trapped molecule could achieve significantly stronger coupling to these microwaves by its rotational transitions. This could ultimately be leveraged to investigate cavity-QED effects with a microwave resonator and trapped molecules. Coupling between quantum systems (of different architectures) could be achieved by exchange of microwave photons. I will present our design for a prototype molecule chip, and discuss the recent developments in cold molecuels that have made it realisable.
