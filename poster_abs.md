Chip traps have proven themselves to be a robust, miniaturized environment for
probing of ultracold atoms in high field gradients. Coherent control in such a
trap is possible by coupling hyperfine transitions in the atom to microwaves
propagating through on-chip waveguides. A trapped molecule could achieve
significantly stronger coupling to these microwaves by its rotational
transitions. This could ultimately be leveraged to investigate cavity-QED
effects with a microwave resonator and trapped molecules; all integrated on a
single microfabricated device. Coupling between quantum systems (of different
architectures) could be achieved by exchange of microwave photons. I will
present our design for a prototype molecule chip, and discuss the recent
developments in cold molecuels that have made it realisable.
