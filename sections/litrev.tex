At the time of the original molecule chip proposal~\cite{Andre2006}, to see atom
chips had been loaded using a magneto-optical trap (MOT) as a
source~\cite{Reichel1999, Ott2001}, however a molecule MOT had not yet been
built, and there was no credible source of loading a chip of this
type.\footnote{\cm{Flyover chips had been created, maybe something about PSD
meant a beam wouldn't work? expand in body}}

Today we have access to molecules cooled below the Doppler
temperature~\cite{Truppe2017}, with potential for further sympathetic cooling
with rubidium~\cm{how to cite this?}.

In this section, we will review the state of the field and discuss the existing
technologies that will be key to implemenenting a molecule chip.
