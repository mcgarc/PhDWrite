Quantum optical systems are promising candidates for use in a vast range of
technologies, from metrology, to simulation, to probing the fundamentals of
physics. But despite their high controllability and coherence times, they often
lack scalability, requiring large optical systems to function.

Chip traps were introduced as a means of miniaturizing such systems. Magnetic
traps have been formed from fields generated by wires on a substrate and
external bias fields. This forms a robust trapping environment with very high
field gradients. Chips are innately scalable due to their fabrication by
well-understood standard photolithographic methods, and have been
routinely used for experiments with atoms, particularly in formation of
Bose-Einstein condensates. They show promise for control, and integration with
other quantum systems via coupling to microwave guides also integrated with the
chip.

With the development of new technologies into the creation of ultra-cold
molecules, creation of a molecule chip is now a possibility. Rotational states
of molecules couple strongly to microwave fields, which could allow the
exploitation of cavity QED effects for use in a scalable system which can be
integrated with other quantum architectures.

In this report, we present ongoing work into development of a molecule chip.
