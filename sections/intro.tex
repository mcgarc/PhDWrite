\cm{Para on cooling of atoms, along with applications, then introduce need for
atom chips: The ability to laser cool molecules and atoms has opened the
door...}

When Weinstein and Libbrecht first proposed a scheme for microscopic confinement
of atoms using microfabricated magnetic traps~\cite{PhysRevA.52.4004}, it was at
a time when production, ultra-cooling and trapping of atoms was already well
understood and commonly practiced.~\cm{TODO: cites for each of these} Only four
years later, Reichel et al.~\cite{Reichel1999} demonstrated the first atomic
``chip trap,'' a microfabricated device using wires on the surface of a planar
substrate. By the nature of the design and fabrication technique, a chip trap is
more robust and scalable than its macroscopic counterparts~\cm{TODO: cite} and
as such has many applications in quantum technology.

\cm{TODO: find examples and continue talking about applications as separate
paragraph note espeically MW stuff. Need to introduce MOT as a concept. OR maybe
this gives way to opening para}

In 2006, Andre et al.~\cite{Andre2006} published a proposal for a molecular chip
trap. The coupling microwaves to the rotational structure of a diatomic molecule
would be several orders of magnitude stronger than the coupling to hyperfine
transitions in an atom. \cm{Why is this good?}

At the time of proposal, the field of ultracold molecules was still relatively
unexplored, with the first molecular MOT was not created until~\cm{cite molecule
MOT}. Indeed production of cold molecules has shown in many ways to be more
challenging than for atoms, in large part due to the significantly more complex
energy sturcutre they exhibit.~\cm{CITE} Today however we are able to cool
molecules below the Doppler limit~\cite{Truppe2017}, coherently control the
states of such molecules~\cite{PhysRevLett.120.163201} and load molecules into a
tweezer array.~\cite{Anderegg2019}

\cm{TODO: redo this}
The groundwork has been laid to produce a molecular chip trap. In the following
subsections I will discuss further the field of ultra-cooling of atoms molecules, and
the need for a molecule chip. The rest of the report will focus on chip
trapping, the design of our molecule chip and the outlook for the remainder of
the project.

\subsection{Laser cooling of atoms and molecules}
\label{intro:lasercool}

A brief discussion of laser cooling is presented here. More detailed discussion
can be found in references~\cite{Metcalf1999,RevModPhys.70.721,McCarron_2018}.

The basic principle of laser cooling of atoms is to deflect atoms from their
trajectory by transfer of momentum from the laser light (radiation
pressure).~\cite{RevModPhys.70.721} Consider an atom with velocity $v$, and a
pre-chosen cooling transition between two internal states.  When such an atom
encounters a counter-propogating resonant photon absorption can take place,
reducing the atom's momentum. The atom can re-emit the photon in any direction,
but on average the resulting atom will be slowed from before the encounter.

Of course, the assumption of a two-level system is a vast simplification.  A key
example is sodium, where the hyperfine transition $3S_{1/2}\, (F=2) \rightarrow
3P_{3/2}\, (F'=3)$ transition was used to demonstrate this technique. However,
since the excited states of sodium have decay channels into $F=1$, it is
possible for atoms to fall into this state and fall out of resonance with the
cooling transition.  This can be overcome by introducing repumping light to
transfer atoms in dark states back into light states.~\cite{RevModPhys.70.721}

Most atom sources produce a beam, with typical velocities of a few
\SI{100}{\metre\per\second}.~\cite{Metcalf1999,} In order to induce resonant
transitions, the Doppler shift of the light as seen by the atoms must be
accounted for by detuning the cooling light. As the atoms are slowed they will
move out of resonance with the transition.~\cite{RevModPhys.70.721} This can be
overcome by introducing chriped light~\cite{Prodan1984} or varying the
transition frequency by control of an external splitting
field~\cite{PhysRevLett.48.596}.

An optical molasses can be formed from a pair of counter-propogating laser
beams, both red-detuned from the cooling transition. If the atom moves towards
either beam it will move into resonace and experience a pressure back towards
the trap centre.~\cite{} A set of three perpendicular optical molasses can
cool an atom in each direction, reducing the temperature but not providing any
trapping force. This technique is known as Doppler cooling~\cite{}. Further
cooling can be achieved in an optical molasses by choosing the polarization of
the light such that there is a polarization gradient. This sub-Doppler cooling
allows atoms to be cooled to the lowest limit, the recoil temperature of the
atoms (typically a few \si{\micro\kelvin}).~\cm{TODO: CITE AND CHECK ACCURACTY}

Trapping can be achieved (for example) by optically pumping the atoms into a
weak-field seeking state and aplying a magnetic field to form either a
quadrupole~\cite{} or Ioffe-Pritchard~\cite{PhysRevLett.51.1336} trap. A
quadrupole trap combined with an optical molasses forms a magneto-optical trap
(MOT)~\cite{PhysRevLett.59.2631}. The MOT has become a fundamental component of
many cold atom experiments.

\cm{Other things, state control, dipole traps, evaporative cooling, tweezers, chips?}

The techniques of laser slowing atoms are readily applied to molecules, however
their rich energy structure introduces additional complications, meaning that
there are a restricted number of molecules which are receptive to direct laser
cooling~\cite{DiRosa2004}.

As well as directly laser cooling molecules, work has been conducted into
producing cold \cm{$RbCs$} molecules from pre-cooled molecules. Atoms trapped in
an optical lattice can be combined by Feshbach
resonance~\cite{PhysRevA.85.032506, PhysRevA.89.033604} and then transfered into
their ro-vibrational ground state by stimulated Raman adiabatic passage
(STIRAP).~\cite{PhysRevLett.113.255301, RevModPhys.70.1003}.

\subsection{Structure of this report}

In this document, I will outline the ongoing progress in the design and
implementation of a molecular chip trap. In section \ref{litrev} I will present
the existing research that has been undertaken in the fields of atomic and
molecular chip traps. Next, section \ref{experiment} will discuss the design
process for our experiment, and the various engineering challenges that we have
had to overcome. Finally I will present the outlook for the remainder of the
project, including some \cm{stretch goals??}
