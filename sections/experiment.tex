\subsection{Microwaves on a chip}

As discussed in the previous section, it is highly beneficial to be able to
incorporate microwave waveguides onto the chip surface. The structure most
commonly used for this application is the coplanar waveguide (CPW)~\cite{},
which was was originally proposed by Cheng P.~Wen in 1969.~\cite{1127105} CPWs
are formed from a conductor layer on some dielectric substrate, with two
channels of conuctor carved out in order to create a centre conductor strip,
with the other conucting regions forming a surrouding ground plane.

A segment of a CPW is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{experiment:fig:CPWxsec}. The
CPW's geometry is defined by the centre conductor width ($S$) and the channel
width ($W$). The geometry of the CPW determines the region the microwave field
occupies, as illustrated in \myfigref{experiment:fig:CPWfield}. The CPW can
therefore be used to maximise overlap between the microwave field and the
trapped molecules.

    features of a centre conductor of width $S$, which is isolated from the

    cable, where the centre conductor takes the place of the central pin and the
    ground plane the shielding. This figure is reporoduced from
    reference~\cite{Simons2004}}.

\end{figure}

As with any waveguide, impedance matching a CPW at the interfaces between
sections (for example between CPWs on different substrates, which can be joined
by a wire bond~\cite{rohtua}) will minimise reflections.~\cite{Jackson1975} We
also aim to understand attenuation in the waveguide, with the goal of
fabricating a microwave resonator as described in Andr\'e et
al.~\cite{Andre2006}

In the remainder of this subsection I will outline the basic mathematical
description of a CPW. For our purposes it will be sufficient to consider the
case where the height of the substrate ($h1$) far exceeds the other distances,
that is $h_1 \gg S$, whilst $S \sim W$. The conductor is assumed to be perfect,
and the dielectric has relative permittivity $\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}$.

\subsubsection{CPW Impedance}

It is common to define the planar geometry in terms of the
ratio~\cite{1127105, Simons2004}
\begin{equation}
  k_0 = \frac{S}{S+2W} = \sqrt{1-{k'_0}^2}
  \label{eqn:k0def}
\end{equation}
where the second equality defines $k'_0$.
%
Wen demonstrated~\cite{1127105} that a conformal mapping can be used to describe
a CPW as a transmission line~\cite{Jackson1975} in terms of elliptic integrals
of the first kind $K(k)$. The capacitance of a the dielectric region of the CPW
is given by
\begin{equation}
  C_\mathrm{CPW} = 2\epsilon_0(\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}-1)\frac{K(k_0)}{K(k'_0)}
\end{equation}
and the capacitance of the air region is
\begin{equation}
  C_\mathrm{air} = 4\epsilon_0 \frac{K(k_0)}{K(k'_0)}.
\end{equation}
We can use this to find the effective permittivity 
\begin{align}
  \epsilon_\mathrm{eff} &= \frac{C_\mathrm{CPW}}{C_\mathrm{air}} \\
    &= \frac{1+ \epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}{2} \\
\end{align}
the phase velocity (using $c$ as the speed of light)
\begin{align}
  v_\mathrm{ph} &= \frac{c}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}}} \\
    &= \frac{c}{\sqrt{(1 + \epsilon_\mathrm{r1})/2}}
\end{align}
and ultimately the impedance of the CPW\footnote{This result makes use of the
approximation $\sqrt{\mu_0/\epsilon_0}\approx120\pi\mathrm{[Ohms]}$, which is
used commonly in microwave engineering~\cm{TODO: Cite}}
\begin{align}
  Z_0 &= \frac{1}{C_\mathrm{CPW} v_\mathrm{ph}} \\
    &= \frac{30 \pi}{\sqrt{(\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}+1)/2}} \frac{K(k_0)}{K(k'_0)}
    \mathrm{[Ohms]}
\end{align}
Note that the impedance of the waveguide has dependence only on the geometry in
the form of the ratio $k_0$, and the relative permittivity of the
substrate.~\cite{Simons2004} This means that for any substrate we choose the
value of $k_0$ can be chosen to fix the impedance at the standard $Z_0 =
\SI{50}{\ohm}$.

This means that as long as $k_0$ is held constant,
the CPW can be tapered to change the size of the centre conductor, and hence
control the region the field occupies (c.f. \myfigref{experiment:fig:CPWfield}).
A typical CPW taper is illustrated in
\myfigref{experiment:fig:CPWtaper}.~\cm{TODO: find a nice mw/ CPW cite for this}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{CPW Resonators}

Andre\'e et al.~\cite{Andre2006} proposed a molecule chip where the trap was
embedded in a resonator formed from a CPW. In this subsubsection I will present
the implementation and theory of CPW microwave resonators, with a view to
determine whether or not such an architecture is feasible.

A microwave resonator can be formed from a section of CPW that is capacitively
coupled to another driving segment.~\cite{Day2003} The properties of such a
resonstor are deterimined by the geometry, including its length and the nature
of the capacitor structures, which can be made up of gaps, or overlapping
fingers. An example of such a resonator is shown in
\myfigref{experiment:fig:resonator}.~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3010859} \cm{also cite
some textbook on resonators more generally?}

\begin{figure}
  \cm{TODO: Gopel fig. 2}
  \caption{
    \cm{A CPW resonator, note the presence of tapers as per the prev. fig.}
  }
  \label{experiment:fig:resonator}
\end{figure}

A CPW resonator of length $L$ has fundamental angular frequency
\begin{equation}
  \omega_0 = \frac{\pi v_\mathrm{ph}}{L} = \frac{\pi
  c}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\text{eff}} L}
\end{equation}

To determine the feasibility of implementing such a resonator, the quality
factor should be considered. By definition the quality factor of a perfect
damped resonator is propotional to the ratio of energy stored and energy lost
per cycle, that is~\cm{cite some standard textbook}
\begin{equation}
  Q = 2\pi\frac{U_\mathrm{max}}{U_\mathrm{lost}}.
  \label{experiment:mw:eqn:Qdef}
\end{equation}
It can readily be shown that the quality factor can be expressed in terms of the
attenuation constant $\alpha$ (defined below) and the resonant frequency
$\omega_0$, so that~\cite{Simons2004}
% Simons pg. 409-410
\begin{equation}
  Q = \frac{\omega_0}{2c\alpha}.
  \label{experiment:mw:eqn:Qalpha}
\end{equation}
It is desirable to maximise $Q$ (minimise damping). It has been shown that CPWs
with $Q$ on the order of $1000$ can be fabricated~\cm{Need a few decent cites
here}. Below we will discuss whether this can be achieved for a multi-layer,
non-superconducting chip.

% Talk about "insertion loss" which is in Simon's 12. (pg. 410??)
In reality, the quality factor has some dependence on the capacitive coupling
into the resonator.~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3010859} Broadly speaking, a higher
coupling capacitance corresponds to a wider resonance peak, however as we shall
show in the next section, this is not the limiting factor of any CPW resonator
that we will consider implementing at this stage.

\subsubsection{Microwave loss modes}

\cm{Need cites in this subsubsection}

The attentuation constant is defined as the real part of the propogation
constant $\gamma = \alpha + i\beta$, where $\beta = 2\pi / \lambda$ is the wave
number.  Propogation through a waveguide induces evolution described by
\begin{equation}
  \widetilde{E}(z) = \widetilde{E}(0)e^{-\gamma z}.
  \label{experiment:mw:eqn:Eloss}.
\end{equation}
Taking the absolute value, the amplitude falls off as
\begin{equation}
  E(z) = E(0)e^{-\alpha z}
\end{equation}
where the attenuation is given by the sum of attenuation from three loss modes:
dielectric loss ($\alpha_d$), conductor loss ($\alpha_c$) and radiation loss
($\alpha_r$). The propagation constant can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \alpha_d + \alpha_c + \alpha_r.
\end{equation}

It is instructive to consider the quality factor of a resonator for one loss
mechanism, ignoring the effect of the others. These are given as
\begin{equation}
  Q_i = \frac{\omega_0}{2c\alpha_i}
\end{equation}
with the total quality factor being
\begin{equation}
  Q = \left(\sum Q_i^{-1} \right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}

In the following \cm{subsub?}sections, we will discuss the quality factor from
each loss mode and determine the value of $Q$ that we expect to be able to
achieve. These propagation constants can be determined by use of the conformal
mapping technique as discussed in references~\cite{1127105}
and~\cite{Collin2007}.

\subsubsection*{Dielectric losses}

Dielectric losses can be described in terms of the dielectric loss tangent of
the substrate ($\tan \delta_e$) ~\cite{Collin2007}
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_d =
  \frac{\omega_0}{4c}\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}}}
  \tan \delta_e.
\end{equation}
A typical microwave substrate is chosen to minimise these dielectric losses. As
such we would expect $\tan\delta_e\leq10^{-3}$ and
$\epsilon_\mathrm{r1} \sim 10$ so the limit on the dielectric loss component is
%
\cm{Need to mention $\omega_0/2\pi = \SI{40}{\giga\hertz}$}
%
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_d \leq \SI{0.9}{\neper\per\meter},
\end{equation}
or as a Q-factor
\begin{equation}
  Q_d \geq 460.
\end{equation}

Higher $Q$ is achievable depending on the substrate that is chosen. For example,
aluminium nitride~\cite{mw101} \cm{Probably need to double check this cite
appears sensibly} ($\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}=5$, $\tan\delta_e = 5\times10^{-4}$)
or high-resistivity silicon (HiRes Si)~\cite{1717770}
($\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}=5$, $\tan\delta_e =2\times10^{-4}$) are both good
choices in the high-frequency r\'egime.  Dielectric quality is usually higher
below room temperature, but experimental limitations prevent us from cooling the
chip at this stage.

\subsubsection*{Conductor losses}

Conductor losses arise due to dissipation in the centre conductor and ground
plane of the CPW.~\cite{Simons2004} We define the height of these structures to
be $t$, so that the series resistance of the centre conductor is
\begin{equation}
  R_c = \frac{R_s}{4 S(1-k_0^2)K^2(k_0)}\left[ \pi + \log\left(\frac{4\pi
  S}{t}\right) - k_0\log\left(\frac{1+k_0}{1-k_0}\right) \right],
\end{equation}
and the corresponding series resistance of the ground plane
\begin{equation}
  R_s = \frac{k_0 R_s}{4S(1-k_0^2)K^2(k_0)}\left[\pi +
  \log\left(\frac{4\pi(S+2W)}{t}\right) -
  \frac{1}{k_0}\log\left(\frac{1+k_0}{1-k_0}\right)\right].
\end{equation}
The conductor attenuation constant is
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_c = \frac{R_c +R_g}{2Z_0}.
\end{equation}

Consider an example case of gold conductor on HiRes Si substrate. Gold has
resistivity $\rho_\mathrm{Au} = \SI{2.4E-8}{\ohm\metre}$ at room temperature,
and as above, we will have $\epsilon_\mathrm{r1} \approx 10$. This requires $k_0
\approx 1/3$ to achieve impedance matching at $Z_0 = \SI{50}{\ohm}$. The only
free parameters are the conductor thickness $t$, and the size of the centre
width conductor $S$, both of which must be maximised to reduce loss. Typical
values for the smallest CPWs will be $S\sim\SI{1}{\micro\metre}$, where
this heigh can be achieved by electroplating (see section \cm{??}). Typical
conductor losses are therefore expected to be off order
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_c \sim \SI{400}{\neper\per\metre}
\end{equation}
or as a quality factor
\begin{equation}
  Q_c \sim 1.
\end{equation}

Conductor losses for gold CPWs are large, but it is possible to use
superconductors to produce resonators with $Q$ on the order of
$1000$.~\cite{Booth1999, Wallraff2004} However as discussed above, cooling of
the chip is not currently possible due to experimental restrictions, and hence
we are not able to make use of superconductors to reach these high quality
factors.

\subsubsection*{Radiative losses}

The radiation losses of a CPW have been calculated and measured by Frankel et
al.~\cite{Frankel1991}, who show that
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_r = \frac{\pi^2 \omega_0^3}{2^7}\left(\frac{\left(1 -
  \frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}}{\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}\right)^2}{\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}}{\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}}}\right)
  \frac{(S+2W)^2\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}^{3/2}}{c^3 K(k'_0)K(k_0)}.
\end{equation}.
Inserting typical values, we retrieve
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_r \sim \SI{0.4}{\neper\per\metre}
\end{equation}
corresponding to a minimum quality factor
\begin{equation}
  Q_r \geq 1000
\end{equation}
which agrees with the measurements made by Frankel et al. which were for CPWs of
similar geometry and frequency domain to our intended usage.

\subsubsection*{Comparison of loss mechanisms}

It is clear that without use of superconductors, the conductor loss will far
dominate the other sources, with an overall quality factor $Q\sim1$. Typical
resonators will operate with much higher $Q$~\cite{}, so it will not be possible
to implement a resonator.

That said, it should be noted that the high loss should not prevent us from
using the CPW to directly drive microwave transitions in trapped molecules, as
we will still be able to pass signal through the waveguide without the need to
construct a waveguide. With loss of $\alpha \approx \alpha_r$, and waveguides of
lengths on the scale of a few centimetre, we can expect a total loss of around
$\SI{400}{\neper\per\metre} \times \SI{0.01}{\metre} = \SI{35}{\decibel}$. This
should be sufficiently small that microwaves will be able to reach molecules
trapped on the chip.~\cite{Treutlein2008}
%
% THESIS: Expand on this
One of the later goals of the project will be to characterise microwave losses
on the chip and compare these with those expected from theory.

An important consequence of being unable to implement a microwave resonator is
that it becomes impossible to implement the electrostatic trap proposed by
Andr\'e et al.~\cite{Andre2006} as this relied on the ability to introduce a
bias voltage on the centre conductor of the resonator in order to form the trap.
\cm{Need a fig. maybe reference above if it's included there?} It is possible to
bias the centre conductor (as detailed in
reference~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3573824}) but it is not possible to do the same
for a waveguide.

\subsection{Chips with multiple layers}

% Talk about CPW on polyimide

\cm{Something like: We need to have the CPW and the trapping wires on the same
chip. The only feasible way of doing this is to stack them on top of each other,
as was done by these people.}

As the microwave attenuation prevents implementation of a resonator (and hence
implementation of an electrostatic trap integrated with the waveguide) another
solution for trapping and control of the microwaves must be found. Since
magnetic trapping of atoms above a chip has been extensively researched (see
section~\ref{litrev}, we have chosen this mechanism for trapping of molecules
above the chip. \cm{Need to say that macroscopic magnetic trapping of CaF is a
thing.}

Combining the CPW with the trapping wires on a single layer was extensively
explored, however no geometry was found that would allow for satisfactory
overlap between the microwave field and the molecules. It was determined that a
multi-layer chip should be used, similar to those designed
by Treutlein~\cite{Treutlein2008} and B\"ohi~\cite{rohuta} and discussed in
section ~\ref{litrev:control}. \cm{TODO} A layer of insulating resin can be
spin-coated on top of the trapping wire layer, forming a substrate for the CPW.
Trapping magnetic fields will be used to trap directly above the CPW.

The resin used by Treutlein and B\"ohi~\cite{Treutlein2008, rohtua} was
polyimide, which has the benefit of being highly resistant to cleaning
techniques commonly used in photolithography, including pirranah clean. The
polyimide is also effective as a microwave substrate~\cite{Simons2004,
B\"Boehi2009} ($\epsilon_\mathrm{r1} = 3.3$, $\tan\delta_e = 0.016$) with
conductor losses still dominating dielectric.
