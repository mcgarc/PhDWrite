To summarise the previous sections, there are good prospects for developing a
molecule chip using magnetic traps integrated with on-chip microwave guides for
coherent quantum control and measurement. Such a device would take advantage of
magnetically insensitive rotational transisions in \CaF{} to form a qubit with
long coherence times. Forming a microwave resonator on chip will allow the use
of powerful techniques due to cavity QED effects.

\thesis{Have referred to a quibt here, but I think I should actually avoid this
and find a better way to refer to it. Mayb have to introduce above.}

Now I will present a plan for implementation of such a chip, beginning with a
discussion of propagating microwaves on the surface of a chip and moving on to
look at integration of the trapping wires and microwave guides by use of
multiple layers. The chip design will then be presented followed by a proposed
loading scheme.

\subsection{Microwaves on a chip}

As discussed in the previous section, it is highly beneficial to be able to
incorporate microwave waveguides onto the chip surface. The structure most
commonly used for this application is the coplanar waveguide
(CPW)~\cite{1127105, Simons2004}, which was was originally proposed by Cheng
P.~Wen in 1969.~\cite{1127105} CPWs are formed from a conductor layer on a
dielectric substrate, with two channels of conductor carved out in order to
create a centre conductor strip, and the other conducting regions forming a
surrounding ground plane.  A segment of a CPW is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{experiment:fig:CPWxsec}.

\thesis{Should replace this paragraph with some COMSOL simulation and further
discussion. Figure should be from our COMSOL sims not Simons.}
%
The CPW's geometry is defined by the centre conductor width ($S$) and the
channel width ($W$). The geometry of the CPW determines the region the microwave
field occupies, as illustrated in \myfigref{experiment:fig:CPWfield}. The CPW
can therefore be designed to maximise overlap between the microwave field and
the trapped molecules. As a rough approximation the molecules should be trapped
at a distance $h\sim S$ above the centre of the CPW to achieve a good
overlap.~\cite{Boehi2009}

\thesis{I can combine these two theses into one reference. Probably a good idea,
but don't have time right now. The way to do it is to cite them as
\\cite{Treutlein2008, *Boehi2009}
but it seems that I would have to change every single instance to make this work
properly.

    features of a centre conductor of width $S$, which is isolated from the

    cable, where the centre conductor takes the place of the central pin and the
    ground plane the shielding. This figure is reproduced from

\end{figure}

We must ensure that coupling between CPW microwaves and trapped molecules is
achievable. In this section we will focus on ensuring that the microwaves will
be able to propagate along the waveguide. This will rely on impedance matching
at CPW interfaces and satisfactory levels of attenuation on the
chip.~\cite{Jackson1975, Simons2004}. We will now outline the basic mathematical
description of a CPW.  For our purposes it will be sufficient to consider the
case where the height of the substrate ($h1$) far exceeds the other distances,
that is $h_1 \gg S$, whilst $S \sim W$. The conductor is assumed to be perfect,
and the dielectric has relative permittivity $\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}$.

\subsubsection{CPW Impedance}

It is common to define the planar geometry in terms of the
ratio~\cite{1127105, Simons2004}
\begin{equation}
  k_0 = \frac{S}{S+2W} = \sqrt{1-{k'_0}^2}
  \label{eqn:k0def}
\end{equation}
where the second equality defines $k'_0$.
%
Wen demonstrated~\cite{1127105} that a conformal mapping can be used to describe
a CPW as a transmission line~\cite{Jackson1975} in terms of elliptic integrals
of the first kind $K(k)$. The capacitance of a the dielectric region of the CPW
is given by
\begin{equation}
  C_\mathrm{CPW} = 2\epsilon_0(\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}-1)\frac{K(k_0)}{K(k'_0)}
\end{equation}
and the capacitance of the air region is
\begin{equation}
  C_\mathrm{air} = 4\epsilon_0 \frac{K(k_0)}{K(k'_0)}.
\end{equation}
We can use this to find the effective permittivity 
\begin{align}
  \epsilon_\mathrm{eff} &= \frac{C_\mathrm{CPW}}{C_\mathrm{air}} \\
    &= \frac{1+ \epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}{2} \\
\end{align}
the phase velocity (using $c$ as the speed of light)
\begin{align}
  v_\mathrm{ph} &= \frac{c}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}}} \\
    &= \frac{c}{\sqrt{(1 + \epsilon_\mathrm{r1})/2}}
\end{align}
and ultimately the impedance of the CPW\footnote{This result makes use of the
approximation $\sqrt{\mu_0/\epsilon_0}\approx120\pi\mathrm{[Ohms]}$, which is
used commonly in microwave engineering~\cite{Collin2007}}
\begin{align}
  Z_0 &= \frac{1}{C_\mathrm{CPW} v_\mathrm{ph}} \\
    &= \frac{30 \pi}{\sqrt{(\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}+1)/2}} \frac{K(k_0)}{K(k'_0)}
    \mathrm{[Ohms]}
\end{align}
Note that the impedance of the waveguide has dependence only on the geometry in
the form of the ratio $k_0$, and the relative permittivity of the
substrate.~\cite{Simons2004} This means that for any substrate we choose the
value of $k_0$ can be chosen to fix the impedance at the standard $Z_0 =
\SI{50}{\ohm}$.

Therefore as long as $k_0$ is held constant the CPW can be tapered to change the
size of the centre conductor, and hence control the region the field occupies
(c.f. \myfigref{experiment:fig:CPWfield}).  Various typical CPW tapers  can be
seen in in \myfigref{experiment:fig:resonator}.~\cite{Simons2004}

\subsubsection{CPW Resonators}
\label{experiment:mw:resonator}

Andr\'e et al.~\cite{Andre2006} proposed a molecule chip where the trap was
embedded in a resonator formed from a CPW. In this subsubsection I will present
the implementation and theory of CPW microwave resonators, with a view to
determine whether or not such an architecture is feasible.

A microwave resonator can be formed from a section of CPW that is capacitively
coupled to another driving segment.~\cite{Day2003} The properties of such a
resonator are determined by the geometry, including its length and the nature
of the capacitor structures, which can be made up of gaps, or overlapping
fingers. An example of such a resonator is shown in
\myfigref{experiment:fig:resonator}.~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3010859, Pain1999}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./figs/gopl_cpw.png}
  \caption{
    A CPW resonator is shown (D) along with various capacitor structures: 8
    finger capacitor (E), two finger capacitor (H) and gap capacitors (I and K).
    The capacitors isolate a segment of the central conductor to form the
    resonator. Note that the curving of the CPW allows longer lengths to fit
    into a shorter region without adversely affecting
    transmission.~\cite{Simons2004} A taper can be seen at each end of the
    resonator, with $k_0$ and hence $Z_0$ conserved.
    This figure is reproduced from reference~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3010859}.
  }
  \label{experiment:fig:resonator}
\end{figure}

A CPW resonator of length $L$ has fundamental angular frequency
\begin{equation}
  \omega_0 = \frac{\pi v_\mathrm{ph}}{L} = \frac{\pi
  c}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\text{eff}} L}
\end{equation}

To determine the feasibility of implementing such a resonator, the quality
factor should be considered. By definition the quality factor of a perfect
damped resonator is proportional to the ratio of energy stored and energy lost
per cycle, that is~\cite{Pain1999}
\begin{equation}
  Q = 2\pi\frac{U_\mathrm{max}}{U_\mathrm{lost}}.
  \label{experiment:mw:eqn:Qdef}
\end{equation}
It can readily be shown that the quality factor can be expressed in terms of the
attenuation constant $\alpha$ (defined below) and the resonant frequency
$\omega_0$, so that~\cite{Simons2004}
% Simons pg. 409-410
\begin{equation}
  Q = \frac{\omega_0}{2c\alpha}.
  \label{experiment:mw:eqn:Qalpha}
\end{equation}
It is desirable to maximise $Q$ (minimise damping). It has been shown that CPWs
with $Q$ on the order of $1000$ can be fabricated.~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3010859,
Hattermann2017} Below we will discuss whether this can be achieved in our case.

\subsubsection{Microwave loss modes}

The attenuation constant is defined as the real part of the propagation
constant $\gamma = \alpha + i\beta$, where $\beta = 2\pi / \lambda$ is the wave
number.~\cite{Simons2004} Propagation through a waveguide induces evolution
described by
%
\begin{equation}
  \widetilde{E}(z) = \widetilde{E}(0)e^{-\gamma z}.
  \label{experiment:mw:eqn:Eloss}.
\end{equation}
%
Taking the absolute value, the amplitude falls off as
%
\begin{equation}
  E(z) = E(0)e^{-\alpha z}
\end{equation}
%
where the attenuation is given by the sum of attenuation from three loss modes:
dielectric loss ($\alpha_d$), conductor loss ($\alpha_c$) and radiation loss
($\alpha_r$). The propagation constant can be written as
%
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \alpha_d + \alpha_c + \alpha_r.
\end{equation}

It is instructive to consider the quality factor of a resonator for one loss
mechanism, ignoring the effect of the others. These are given
as~\cite{Simons2004}
\begin{equation}
  Q_i = \frac{\omega_0}{2c\alpha_i}
\end{equation}
with the total quality factor being
\begin{equation}
  Q = \left(\sum Q_i^{-1} \right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}

% Talk about "insertion loss" which is in Simon's 12. (pg. 410??)
Note that we will not consider the dependence of the quality factor the
capacitive coupling into the resonator (insertion loss).~\cite{Simons2004,
doi:10.1063/1.3010859} Broadly speaking, a higher coupling capacitance
corresponds to a wider resonance peak, however in our case this effect is
dominated by other forms of loss.

\subsubsection*{Dielectric losses}

Dielectric losses vary linearly with $\tan \delta_e$, the dielectric loss
tangent of the substrate~\cite{Collin2007}
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_d =
  \frac{\omega_0}{4c}\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}}}
  \tan \delta_e.
\end{equation}
A typical microwave substrate is chosen to minimise these dielectric losses. As
such we would expect $\tan\delta_e\leq10^{-3}$ and
$\epsilon_\mathrm{r1} \sim 10$ so the limit on the dielectric loss component is
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_d \leq \SI{0.9}{\neper\per\meter}
\end{equation}
for the \SI{41}{\giga\hertz} transition in \CaF{}. Or as a Q-factor
\begin{equation}
  Q_d \geq 460.
\end{equation}

Higher $Q$ is achievable depending on the substrate that is chosen. For example,
aluminium nitride~\cite{mw101}  ($\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}=5$, $\tan\delta_e =
5\times10^{-4}$) or high-resistivity silicon (HiRes Si)~\cite{1717770}
($\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}=5$, $\tan\delta_e =2\times10^{-4}$) are both good
choices in the high-frequency r\'egime.  Dielectric quality is usually higher
below room temperature, but experimental limitations prevent us from cooling the
chip at this stage.

% https://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/hard-substrate-materials

\subsubsection*{Conductor losses}

Conductor losses arise due to dissipation in the centre conductor and ground
plane of the CPW.~\cite{Simons2004} We define the height of these structures to
be $t$, so that the series resistance of the centre conductor is
\begin{equation}
  R_c = \frac{R_s}{4 S(1-k_0^2)K^2(k_0)}\left[ \pi + \log\left(\frac{4\pi
  S}{t}\right) - k_0\log\left(\frac{1+k_0}{1-k_0}\right) \right],
\end{equation}
and the corresponding series resistance of the ground plane
\begin{equation}
  R_s = \frac{k_0 R_s}{4S(1-k_0^2)K^2(k_0)}\left[\pi +
  \log\left(\frac{4\pi(S+2W)}{t}\right) -
  \frac{1}{k_0}\log\left(\frac{1+k_0}{1-k_0}\right)\right].
\end{equation}
The conductor attenuation constant is
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_c = \frac{R_c +R_g}{2Z_0}.
\end{equation}

Consider an example case of gold conductor on HiRes Si substrate. Gold has
resistivity $\rho_\mathrm{Au} = \SI{2.4E-8}{\ohm\metre}$ at room temperature,
and as above, we will have $\epsilon_\mathrm{r1} \approx 10$. This requires $k_0
\approx 1/3$ to achieve impedance matching at $Z_0 = \SI{50}{\ohm}$. The only
free parameters are the conductor thickness $t$, and the size of the centre
width conductor $S$, both of which must be maximised to reduce loss. Typical
values for the smallest CPWs will be $S\sim\SI{1}{\micro\metre}$, where
this height can be achieved by electroplating (see below). Typical
conductor losses are therefore expected to be of order
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_c \sim \SI{400}{\neper\per\metre}
\end{equation}
or as a quality factor
\begin{equation}
  Q_c \sim 1.
\end{equation}

Conductor losses for gold CPWs are large, but it is possible to use
superconductors to produce resonators with $Q$ on the order of
$1000$.~\cite{Booth1999, Wallraff2004} However as discussed above, cooling of
the chip is not currently possible due to experimental restrictions, and hence
we are not able to make use of superconductors to reach these high quality
factors.

\subsubsection*{Radiative losses}

The radiation losses of a CPW have been calculated and measured by Frankel et
al.~\cite{Frankel1991}, who show that
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_r = \frac{\pi^2 \omega_0^3}{2^7}\left(\frac{\left(1 -
  \frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}}{\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}\right)^2}{\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}}{\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}}}\right)
  \frac{(S+2W)^2\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}^{3/2}}{c^3 K(k'_0)K(k_0)}.
\end{equation}.
Inserting typical values, we retrieve
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_r \sim \SI{0.4}{\neper\per\metre}
\end{equation}
corresponding to a minimum quality factor
\begin{equation}
  Q_r \geq 1000
\end{equation}
which agrees with the measurements made by Frankel et al. which were for CPWs of
similar geometry and frequency domain to our intended usage.

\subsubsection*{Comparison of loss mechanisms}

It is clear that without use of superconductors, the conductor loss will far
dominate the other sources, with an overall quality factor $Q\sim1$. Typical
resonators will operate with much higher $Q$~\cite{Hattermann2017}, so it will
not be possible to implement a resonator.

That said, it should be noted that the high loss should not prevent us from
using the CPW to directly drive microwave transitions in trapped molecules, as
we will still be able to pass signal through the waveguide without the need to
construct a waveguide. With loss of $\alpha \approx \alpha_r$, and waveguides of
lengths on the scale of a few centimetre, we can expect a total loss of around
$\SI{400}{\neper\per\metre} \times \SI{0.01}{\metre} = \SI{35}{\decibel}$. This
should be sufficiently small that microwaves will be able to reach molecules
trapped on the chip.~\cite{Treutlein2008}
One of the later goals of the project will be to characterise microwave losses
on the chip and compare these with those expected from theory.
%
\thesis{I might be able to expand on this further down the line, but it seems
unnecessary to include now. Maybe need a fig. to explain too?
%
\emph{
A consequence of being unable to implement a microwave resonator is that it
becomes challenging to implement the electrostatic trap proposed by Andr\'e et
al.~\cite{Andre2006} as this relied on the ability to introduce a bias voltage
on the centre conductor of the resonator in order to form the trap. It is
possible to bias the centre conductor (as detailed in
reference~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3573824}) but it is not possible to do the same
for a waveguide.
}}

\subsection{Chips with multiple layers}
\label{experiment:multilayer}

As the microwave attenuation prevents implementation of a resonator (and hence
implementation of an electrostatic trap integrated with the waveguide) another
solution for trapping and control of the microwaves must be found. Since
magnetic trapping of atoms above a chip has been extensively researched (see
section~\ref{litrev}), we have chosen this mechanism for trapping of molecules
above the chip.

Various possible geometries for combining magnetic trapping wires and a CPW have
been extensively explored. It transpires that it is extremely challenging to
construct a geometry with both of these on the same layer that achieves a
satisfactory overlap between the CPW field and the trapping region. To get
around this, a chip with two layers has been designed: the lower layer consists
of an array of DC trapping wires, and an upper layer hosts the CPW. The two are
to be separated by an insulating layer of resin.

Multi-layer chips have been constructed before, notably those by
Treutlein~\cite{Treutlein2008} and B\"ohi~\cite{rohtua}, whose work has heavily
inspired our design. Treutlein and B\"ohi used photolithography followed by
electroplating to create the lower layer (see section \ref{litrev:wiretraps})
then formed the insulating layer by spin-coating polyimide resin in several
stages. This allows the creation of a smooth layer, effectively covering bumps
that can be formed from the underlying wires which avoids significant
discontinuities in the waveguide.

Polyimide is used as the resin as it is highly resistant to cleaning techniques
commonly used in photolithography, including piranha clean.  It is also
effective as a microwave substrate~\cite{Simons2004}
($\epsilon_\mathrm{r1} = 3.3$, $\tan\delta_e = 0.016$) with conductor losses
still dominating those caused by the dielectric.

Using a multi-layer chip introduces thermal constraints on the currents that can
flow through the trapping wires. Current densities achieved by Treutlein and
B\"ohi were \SI{2.8E10}{\ampere\per\metre\squared} in the upper layer and
\SI{5.5E10}{\ampere\per\metre\squared} in the lower layer.

\subsection{Design for a molecular chip trap}

We have designed various multiple-layer chips for prototyping. A series of
Z-traps are to be used for loading molecules from an external trap (see
section~\ref{experiment:loading}) and a CPW for control of the molecules' states
is incorporated on an upper layer. The chip with the trapping wires is shown in
\myfigref{experiment:fig:chipdesign} and is referred to as the science chip.

\begin{figure}[tph]
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./figs/z_trap_fanouts_inset_scale.png}
  \caption{
    A design of a molecule chip, with six overlaid Z-trapping wires and one
    dimple wire (gold) on the lower layer, and a CPW (insulating section in
    blue) on the upper layer.  The lower layer is to be fabricated by
    photolithography and electroplating, then spin coated with polyimide so that
    the second layer can be fabricated above. The Z-traps have varying lengths
    and thicknesses to allow higher current in larger traps, with compression as
    molecules are transferred into smaller traps. The CPW is tapered down to
    localise the microwave field around the smallest traps. Inset: a zoomed view
    of the trapping region.
  }
  \label{experiment:fig:chipdesign}
\end{figure}

A standard \SI{4}{\inch} wafer has space for twelve science chips (each one being
a square with sides of length \SI{2}{\centi\metre}). In the prototype wafer
design, each one has the same set of trapping wires as depicted in
\myfigref{experiment:fig:chipdesign}, but the CPW designs vary. The parameters
changed are the minimum width of the centre conductor (\SI{10}{\micro\metre},
\SI{20}{\micro\metre}, \SI{50}{\micro\metre}); the taper length
(\SI{1}{\milli\metre}, \SI{3}{\milli\metre}); and the orientation of the CPW
track near the molecules (perpendicular or parallel to the trap axis). The full
wafer is shown in \myfigref{experiment:fig:waferdesign}.

The trapping wire design is a series of seven Z-wire traps. Each one is designed
with large fan-outs to aid in conduction of heat and maximise the achievable
current density. A section of polyimide will be scratched of to reveal these so
that they can be wire-bonded to the holding chip (see below). The outer traps
are to be used for trapping at greater heights, meaning they need not be as
narrow as the inner traps. Increasing the wire width means that a greater
current can be achieved in the outer traps, which is useful for forming deep
traps at heights of several hundred micrometres. The specifications of the traps
are shown in \mytabref{experiment:table:traps}.

\end{table}

The goal of this prototype is to characterise the CPWs to check that the
predicted values are met. In particular, we are interested in how the material
under the polyimide (HiRes Si substrate and trapping wires) will affect the
microwave field. We will also be able to test the trapping wires and the
behaviour of the science chip in vacuum. We are optimistic that these prototypes could
ultimately be used for trapping of molecules.

\thesis{How many molecules can we have in the traps and what temperatures?}

The science chip is to be mounted on a heavily modified vacuum flange, shown in
\myfigref{experiment:fig:flange}. This flange will incorporate feedthroughs for
the trapping currents and microwaves, as well as a large U-wire, which will be
used as an intermediate trap in the loading procedure (detailed below). Currents
will be brought in through a nineteen-pin feedthrough  to power the bias coils
and on-chip trapping wires. These currents will feed onto a holding chip, which
will then connect to the science chip via wirebonds. Separate feedthroughs for
the microwaves and U-wire \thesis{(state supplier)} feed onto CPWs on the
holding chip and the U-wire respectively.

    the science chip. Two bias coils will be mounted on the flange, with the

\subsection{Loading scheme}
\label{experiment:loading}

\thesis{Will probably want to revisit this whole section, but an important thing
to do will be to ensure any papers published about this in meantime are cited
accordingly.}

\CaF{} molecules will be loaded onto the chip from a MOT similar to
that described in reference~\cite{Truppe2017}. In the MOT chamber it is planned
to construct a dipole trap, which will be used to increase phase space density
of the molecule cloud

\thesis{Need to figure out specific numbers for phase space density we can
achieve and those required for loading. Include losses and heating from loading
in this calculation.}

Our source of \CaF{} molecules is a MOT similar to that discussed in
reference~\cite{Truppe2017}. The MOT planned to be used for this experiment is
to be used for separate experiments investigating sympathetic cooling between
\esRb{} atoms and \CaF{} in a dipole trap. This is expected to produce a \CaF{}
cloud suitable for loading onto the chip.

The cloud will then be transferred into a magnetic transport trap (MTT) formed of
a pair of anti-Helmholtz coils external to the chambers. The dipole trap will be
switched off and the current in the coils ramped up to form a quadrupole trap.
The coils are mounted on a transport stage, such that they and hence the centre
of the quadrupole, can be moved across to neighbouring chambers. The trapped
cloud of \CaF{} and \esRb{} will be transported in the magnetic trap.
The MTT has been designed for loading into a neighbouring tweezer experiment,
however this will be extended to allow loading onto the chip. The MOT, MTT and
tweezer experiment are shown in \myfigref{experiment:fig:MTTsetup}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./figs/existing_chambers.png}
  \caption{
    The MOT and tweezer chambers for existing experiments. The magnetic
    transport trap (MTT) is used made up of a pair of transport coils arranged
    in anti-Helmholtz configuration. These generate a quadrupole field, which
    will move with the coils on a translation stage, allowing the transfer of
    molecules trapped in the MOT chamber into the tweezer chamber. The chip
    chamber will be positioned further downstream (left) of the tweezer chamber.
    This CAD was undertaken by Kyle Jarvis.
  }
  \label{experiment:fig:MTTsetup}
\end{figure}

The chip flange will be mounted in a third chamber downstream from the MOT and
tweezer chambers. The flange is to be aligned such that the cloud can pass above
the surface with good clearance, entering on the side of the holding chip opposite
the flange. A macroscopic trap, aligned with the centre of the MTT, can then be
generated by the onboard U-wire and surrounding bias coils. This intermediary
trapping stage will be used to align the cloud with those on the science chip.

The cloud can be brought closer to the surface of the chip by a series of
current ramps in the bias coils and chip wires. By adiabatically changing the
bias fields and currents it is possible to transform the trapping potential
without ever distorting it to the point that it is no longer a trap. An example
of changing trapping height by ramping bias fields is shown in
~\myfigref{experiment:fig:ramptraps}.

    An example of a bias field ramp between the Z1 and Z2 stages of the trapping
    sequence (see \mytabref{experiment:table:loading}). In this stage the
    \SI{3}{\milli\metre} trap is operated at a \SI{3}{\ampere} current. The bias
    field ramp reduces the trapping height from \SI{400}{\micro\metre} (solid)
    to \SI{200}{\micro\metre} (dashed-dots). Two intermediary stages are shown
    at 30\% ramp (dashed) and 60\% ramp (dotted). The potential is transformed
    whilst still forming a trap throughout. Subfigures (a), (b) and (c) show the
    field through the trap centre in the $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions
    respectively.

A ramp is performed by linearly changing the trapping currents (those in the
Z-wires and bias coils). The time over which a ramp should ocurr is expected to
be on the order of tens of microseconds, so that the molecules experience an
adiabatic change of the potential.~\cite{Boehi2009} The proposed series of
trapping stages for loading into the dimple is shown in
\mytabref{experiment:table:loading}, along with required trapping currents and
bias fields.

to keep? Also just realy need to review this. Often don't need an x bias and
$B_0$ is basically always zero. Also qudrupole trap depth.}

  \caption{A series of trapping stages in the loading
  procedure. To move between stages, the currents and fields can be
  adiabatically ramped linearly to the next required value. In the case of
  changing between trapping wires, one current is ramped down to zero, while the
  other is ramped up to the new value to form the trap. An example of a ramping
