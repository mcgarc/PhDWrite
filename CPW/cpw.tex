\title{Coplanar waveguides for use on a molecule chip}
\author{Cameron McGarry}


\begin{document}

\maketitle


The original proposal for a microfabricated molecule chip trap by Andr\'e et
al.~\cite{Andre2006} suggested that an integrated coplanar waveguide (CPW) could
be used to drive microwave transitions in trapped molecules. In this document,
we will review the feasibility of this proposal for a simple single-layer chip.

\section{Basic CPW behaviour}

The coplaner waveguide was originally proposed by Cheng P Wen\footnote{Wen
should be awarded with much kudos for his spectacular naming convention.} in
1969~\cite{1127105}. CPWs are formed from a conductor layer on some substrate,
with two parralel channels of conuctor carved out in order to create a centre
conductor strip, with the other conucting regions forming a surrouding ground
plane. A cut-out of a CPW is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:CPWxsec}. The CPW's
geometry is defined by the centre conductor width ($S=2a$) and the channel width
($W=b-a$). In all cases that will be discussed herein, we will assume that the
height of the substrate ($h1$) far exceeds the other distances, that is $h_1
\sim \infty$.

  \caption{Cross section of a CPW. Taken from Simons~\cite{Simons2004}}
  \label{fig:CPWxsec}
\end{figure}

It is common to define the planar geometry in terms of the ratio
\begin{equation}
  k_0 = \frac{S}{S+2W} = \frac{a}{b}.
  \label{eqn:k0def}
\end{equation}
For this and all other $k_i$ we have the corresponding value
\begin{equation}
  k'_i = \sqrt{1-k^2_i}.
\end{equation}
CPW demonstrates\cite{1127105} that by a conformal mapping of the CPW geometry
we can describe waveguide in terms of elliptic integrals of the first kind
$K(k)$. In our limit we have that
\begin{equation}
  \frac{K(k'_0)}{K(k_0)} = k_0.
  \label{eqn:k0rat}
\end{equation}

The capacitance of a CPW can then be found by considering the contribution due
to the propgation through the air and through the substrate. Wen gives the
total capacitance as
\begin{equation}
  C = 4\epsilon_0\epsilon_\mathrm{eff} k_0^{-1}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_\mathrm{eff} = \frac{1 + \epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}{2}.
  \label{eqn:epsilon_eff_approx}
\end{equation}
However, this is an approximation of the more accurate formula
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_\mathrm{eff} = 1 + q(\epsilon_\mathrm{r1} - 1)
  \label{eqn:epsilon_eff}
\end{equation}
where $q$ is a filling factor, describing the proportion of the wave that
travels inside the dielectric vs. inside the air. Note that we obtain equation
\ref{eqn:epsilon_eff_approx} from \ref{eqn:epsilon_eff} by assuming $q = 1/2$.
A more accurate disucussion of $q$ will be presented below. \cm{TODO: where?}

\cm{TODO: Move filling factor discussion up here?}

\begin{align}
  %L &= \frac{\mu_0}{4} k_0\\
  Z &= \frac{1}{C v_\mathrm{ph}} = \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0
    \epsilon-\mathrm{eff}}}k_0
    &\approx \frac{30\pi}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}}}k_0 \mathrm{[Ohms]}
\end{align}
where  $\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}$ is the
effective permittivity, related to the relative permittivity of the substrate
($\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}$) and the phase speed in the substrate ($v_\mathrm{ph}$)
by
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_\mathrm{eff} = \left(\frac{v_\mathrm{ph}}{c}\right)^{-2} = 
  \frac{1 + \epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}{2}.
\end{equation}

% Note that Simons goes into great detail about the various different
% conductor-surrounded CPWs here, but we don't need to worry about those so
% much. See page 47 of my notebook (2019-01-17) and mathematica notebook
% 2019-01-18_* for information on how some of these terms can be neglected. We
% can just use OG CPW's results

In order to impedance match our CPW (probably to $Z=\SI{50}{\ohm}$) we can choose
the permittivity of our substrate (to the extent that we have choice of
substrate) and the waveguide geometry via choice of $S$ and $W$.

We will also later find that the dielectric loss in general has dependence on
$h_1$, which is in part described by the ratio
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{K(k_1)}{K(k'_1)}
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
  k_1 = \frac{\sinh (\pi S/ 4h_1)}{\sinh [\pi (S+2W)/4h_1]}.
\end{equation*}
It is easy to show computationally that
\begin{equation}
  R = \lim_{h_1 \to \infty} \frac{K(k_1)}{K(k'_1)} \approx 0.563.
  \ref{eqn:kratlim}
\end{equation}


\section{Attenuation}

Ultimately we would like to be able to couple a single photon trapped in a CPW
resonator cavity to a single molecule trapped above the chip, however to fully
understand how this might be achieved we first need an understanding of how a
signal will attenuate as it traverses the CPW.

It is worth noting some basic principles of loss in waveguides \cm{TODO: cite
Collins}
The propogation constant of a transmission line is defined to be the complex
value $\gamma$ such that the amplitude of the signal $A(x)$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
  A(x) = A(0)e^{-\gamma x}.
\end{equation}
In order to describe the attenuation, look at the magnitude of this equation,
writing $\gamma = \alpha +i\beta$,
\begin{equation}
  \lvert\frac{A(x)}{A(0)}\rvert = e^{-\alpha x}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is called the attenuation constant. Taking logs it is clear that
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \frac{1}{x}\log\lvert\frac{A(0)}{A(x)}\rvert\,\si{\neper}
\end{equation}
where we have used `Neper' as the natural unit to desribe loss. We will normally
set $x$ to something sensible such as \SI{1}{\meter} or one wavelength $\lambda$
so that loss is expressed in $\si{\neper}/\mathrm{length}$.

The Neper corresponds to approximately \SI{8.7}{\dB}, as can be seen readily by
comparing the loss formula in dB (which is log-base ten, with a factor of ten
and based on power, not amplitude)
\begin{align*}
  \alpha' &= \frac{1}{x}20\log_{10}\lvert \frac{A(0)}{A(x)} \rvert \si{\dB}\\
          &= \frac{20}{x}{x}\log_{10}(e^{\alpha x}) \si{\dB} \\
          &= 20 \log_{10}(e) \alpha \si{\dB} \\
          &\approx 8.7 \left(\frac{\si{\dB}}{\si{\neper}}\right) \alpha.
\end{align*}

We can anticipate three main sources of loss, those from the dielectric, the
conductor and radiative losses. \cite{Simons2004} The total loss is described
by the summation of each of the contributing terms:
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \alpha_d + \alpha_c + \alpha_r.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Dielectric losses}

Collins \cm{TODO: CITE} tells us that the dielectric loss is given by
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_d =
  \frac{\pi}{\lambda_0}\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}}}
  q \tan \delta_e
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength in free space, $\tan \delta_e$ is the
dielectric loss tangent of the substrate, and $q$ is the filling factor, which
describes the amount of the microwave which travels through the dielectric. The
filling factor is given by
\begin{equation}
  q = \frac{1}{2}\frac{K(k_1)}{K(k'_1)}\frac{K(k'0)}{K(k_0)}.
\end{equation}
Using equations \ref{eqn:k0def} and \ref{eqn:kratlim} we can re-write this as
\begin{equation}
  q = \frac{R}{2}k_0.
\end{equation}
As per the above, $k_0$ is effectively fixed by our impedance matching, so the
dielectric loss will be entirely a function of the properties of the material,
going linearly with $\tan\delta_e$. For an order of magnitude comparison, we can
use the usual $q=1/2$ approximation, and consdier our target frequency
$f\approx\SI{40}{\giga\hertz}$ for
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_d \sim 200\sqrt{2\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}\tan\delta_e
  \si{\neper\per\meter}.
\end{equation}

For a typical substrate we will expect $\tan\delta_e\leq10^{-3}$ and
$\epsilon_\mathrm{r1} \sim 100$ so the limit on the dielectric loss component is
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_d \leq 3 \si{\neper\per\meter}.
\end{equation}

\cm{Conclude this subsection, this seems pretty high (because goes like freq.
and we are on order of magnitude higher than we usually would be...) can we get
some nice substrate (high res Si?) to reduce this? What about  Converting to
Np/wavelength?}

\subsection{Conductor losses}

Conductor losses are well-described by the usual
