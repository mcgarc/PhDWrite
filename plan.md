# ESA Report

## Progress towards a molecular chip trap

1. Introduction
  * Opening spiel: context and justification
  * Laser cooling of molecules (w/ some intro about atoms)
  * Structure of the report

2. Atomic and molecular chip traps
  (This section forms the bulk of the literature review)
  * Wire traps
  * Loading wire traps
  * Molecule chips (mainly guides and decelerators)
  * On-chip coherent control of atoms and molecules)
   
3. Experiment design
  (A discussion of microwave guides, followed by a discussion on the design work
  so far)
  * Microwaves on a chip
    - The coplanar waveguide
    - Microwave resonators
    - Loss modes
    - Losses on different dielectric substrates
  * Chips with multiple layers
  * Integrating trapping wires with a CPW
  * Design for a molecular chip trap
  * Experimental design (with Kyle's CAD stuff)
  * Loading scheme (graphs with currents, fields, etc)

4. Outlook
  (Likely quite a short section on what we actually plan to do with the chips we
  create)
  * Basic trapping experiment
  * State control with microwaves
  * On-chip sympathetic cooling with Rb
  * Implementing a resonator (on a superconducting chip)
