\cm{This chapter should be about the specifics of our implementation, starting
from the source and ending at the U-handover stage. I think I should write this
first to inform the contents of the introduction (I hope I don't need an
additional chapter and a lot of the theory can go in here). The concepts of a
science chip and the microwave stuff should either have already been introduced
or introduced early here so that the reader knows what to expect.}

The science chip is to be mounted on a heavily modified vacuum flange, shown in
\myfigref{experiment:fig:flange}. This flange will incorporate feedthroughs for
the trapping currents and microwaves, as well as a large U-wire, which will be
used as an intermediate trap in the loading procedure (detailed below). Currents
will be brought in through a nineteen-pin feedthrough  to power the bias coils
and on-chip trapping wires. These currents will feed onto a holding chip, which
will then connect to the science chip via wirebonds. Separate feedthroughs for
the microwaves and U-wire \thesis{(state supplier)} feed onto CPWs on the
holding chip and the U-wire respectively.

    Flange assembly for mounting a molecule chip. The science chip will be
    mounted in the centre of the holding chip and wire-bonds will allow current
    to pass between the two. Current will be passed to the holding chip via the
    19-pin feedthrough. There are also high frequency microwave feedthroughs so
    that microwaves can be passed to a CPW on the holding chip, and again onto
    the science chip. Two bias coils will be mounted on the flange, with the
    other required coils attached to the chamber (not pictured). The
    intermediary U-trap is positioned directly beneath the science chip and is
    powered by separate current feedthroughs. The flange will be mounted with
    the chip facing down, so that molecules can be dropped and imaged as they
    fall. This CAD was undertaken by other members of the group.

\subsection{Loading scheme}
\label{experiment:loading}

\thesis{Will probably want to revisit this whole section, but an important thing
to do will be to ensure any papers published about this in meantime are cited
accordingly.}

\CaF{} molecules will be loaded onto the chip from a MOT similar to
that described in reference~\cite{Truppe2017}. \cm{Is this OK? Maybe make a
macro to deal with it...} In the MOT chamber it is planned
to construct a dipole trap, which will be used to increase phase space density
of the molecule cloud

\thesis{Need to figure out specific numbers for phase space density we can
achieve and those required for loading. Include losses and heating from loading
in this calculation.}

Our source of \CaF{} molecules is a MOT similar to that discussed in
reference~\cite{Truppe2017}. The MOT planned to be used for this experiment is
to be used for separate experiments investigating sympathetic cooling between
\esRb{} atoms and \CaF{} in a dipole trap. This is expected to produce a \CaF{}
cloud suitable for loading onto the chip.

\thesis{This (and probably the rest of this section) will need to be updated and
the tense changed.}
The cloud will then be transferred into a magnetic transport trap (MTT) formed of
a pair of anti-Helmholtz coils external to the chambers. The dipole trap will be
switched off and the current in the coils ramped up to form a quadrupole trap.
The coils are mounted on a transport stage, such that they and hence the centre
of the quadrupole, can be moved across to neighbouring chambers. The trapped
cloud of \CaF{} and \esRb{} will be transported in the magnetic trap.
The MTT has been designed for loading into a neighbouring tweezer experiment,
however this will be extended to allow loading onto the chip. The MOT, MTT and
tweezer experiment are shown in \myfigref{experiment:fig:MTTsetup}.

    The MOT and tweezer chambers for existing experiments. The magnetic
    transport trap (MTT) is used made up of a pair of transport coils arranged
    in anti-Helmholtz configuration. These generate a quadrupole field, which
    will move with the coils on a translation stage, allowing the transfer of
    molecules trapped in the MOT chamber into the tweezer chamber. The chip
    chamber will be positioned further downstream (left) of the tweezer chamber.
    This CAD was undertaken by Kyle Jarvis.
  }
  \label{experiment:fig:MTTsetup}
\end{figure}

The chip flange will be mounted in a third chamber downstream from the MOT and
tweezer chambers. The flange is to be aligned such that the cloud can pass above
the surface with good clearance, entering on the side of the holding chip opposite
the flange. A macroscopic trap, aligned with the centre of the MTT, can then be
generated by the onboard U-wire and surrounding bias coils. This intermediary
trapping stage will be used to align the cloud with those on the science chip.

The cloud can be brought closer to the surface of the chip by a series of
current ramps in the bias coils and chip wires. By adiabatically changing the
bias fields and currents it is possible to transform the trapping potential
without ever distorting it to the point that it is no longer a trap. An example
of changing trapping height by ramping bias fields is shown in
~\myfigref{experiment:fig:ramptraps}.

    An example of a bias field ramp between the Z1 and Z2 stages of the trapping
    sequence (see \mytabref{experiment:table:loading}). In this stage the
    \SI{3}{\milli\metre} trap is operated at a \SI{3}{\ampere} current. The bias
    field ramp reduces the trapping height from \SI{400}{\micro\metre} (solid)
    to \SI{200}{\micro\metre} (dashed-dots). Two intermediary stages are shown
    at 30\% ramp (dashed) and 60\% ramp (dotted). The potential is transformed
    whilst still forming a trap throughout. Subfigures (a), (b) and (c) show the
    field through the trap centre in the $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions
    respectively.
  }
  \label{experiment:fig:ramptraps}
\end{figure}

A ramp is performed by linearly changing the trapping currents (those in the
Z-wires and bias coils). The time over which a ramp should occur is expected to
be on the order of tens of microseconds, so that the molecules experience an
adiabatic change of the potential.~\cite{Boehi2009} The proposed series of
trapping stages for loading into the dimple is shown in
\mytabref{experiment:table:loading}, along with required trapping currents and
bias fields.

\thesis{Temperature/ compression? Proportion of molecules we expect to be able
to keep? Also just realy need to review this. Often don't need an x bias and
$B_0$ is basically always zero. Also qudrupole trap depth.}
