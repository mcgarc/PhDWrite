microave guides to couple to \cm{(I think this is right)} the hyperfine structure

\section{The coplanar waveguide}

The coplanar waveguide (CPW) was originally proposed by Cheng P.~Wen as a means
of guiding microwaves across the surface of a dielectric
substrate~\cite{1127105}. It consists of a central conductor with a ground
plane on either side, as pictured in~\myfigref{mws:fig:CPW}. CPWs have become
prolific, since they allow the creation of robust microwave devices, and offer
some benefits over other waveguide architectures, such as the stripline
waveguide, because they can provide circularly polarised fields, and also
provide easy access to the ground plane for shunt connections.

The CPW's geometry is defined by the centre conductor width ($S$) and the
channel width ($W$). The height of the conductor is $t$ and the dielectric
height is $h$.  The geometry of the CPW determines the region the microwave
field occupies, as illustrated in \myfigref{experiment:fig:CPWfield}.  The CPW
can therefore be designed to maximise overlap between the microwave field and a
cloud of molecules trapped nearby.  As a rough approximation the molecules
should be trapped at a distance $h\sim S$ above the centre of the CPW to
achieve a good overlap.~\cite{Boehi2009} The field surrounding the CPW is shown
in \mysubfigref{mws:fig:CPW}{b}, the equations defining this field can be found
analytically~\cite{Simons2004}, or the field can be determined by a
finite-element simulation.

achieved. Note that in a resonator the field will depend on the position in the

\end{figure}

\subsection{CPW properties}

We will now consider the electric properties of a CPW. These will largely
depend on the the planar geometry of the waveguide, which we express in terms
of the ratio~\cite{1127105, Simons2004}
%
\begin{equation}
  k_0 = \frac{S}{S+2W} = \sqrt{1-{k'_0}^2}
  \label{eqn:k0def}
\end{equation}
%
For a waveguide made of a material with conductivity $\sigma$
and permeability $\mu$ and propagating field with frequency $\omega$
there is a skin depth~\cite{Simons2004}
%
\begin{equation}
  \delta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega\mu\sigma}}
\end{equation}
%
and skin effect surface resistance~\cite{Simons2004}
%
\begin{equation}
  R_s = \frac{1}{\sigma\delta}.
\end{equation}

Since the field of the CPW will pass through both the dielectric and the
surrounding air, the CPW's capacitance is the sum of the capacitance of each of
these two parts
%
\begin{equation}
  C_\text{CPW} = C_\text{dielectric} + C_\text{air}.
\end{equation}
%
The method of finding these individual contributions is somewhat involved, so
we simply state the results here in terms of the elliptic integral of the
first kind $K(k)$~\cite{Simons2004}. The capacitance due to the dielectric is
%
%
\begin{equation}
  C_\text{dielectric} = 2\epsilon_0(\epsilon_\text{r1}-1)\frac{K(k_0)}{K(k'_0)}
\end{equation}
%
and the capacitance of the air region is
%
\begin{equation}
  C_\text{air} = 4\epsilon_0 \frac{K(k_0)}{K(k'_0)}.
\end{equation}

We can use this to find the effective permittivity~\cite{Simons2004}
%
\begin{align}
  \epsilon_\text{eff} &= \frac{C_\text{dielectric}}{C_\text{air}} \\
    &= \frac{1+ \epsilon_\text{r1}}{2} \\
\end{align}
%
where we have assumed that we are in the limit of a thick dielectric layer ($h
\gg W$ so that most of the field density is inside the dielectric.
%
The phase velocity (using $c$ as the speed of light) is~\cite{Simons2004}
%
\begin{align}
  v_\text{ph} &= \frac{c}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\text{eff}}} \\
    &= \frac{c}{\sqrt{(1 + \epsilon_\text{r1})/2}}.
\end{align}

Now using the approximation~\cite{Collin2007}
$\sqrt{\mu_0/\epsilon_0}\approx120\pi\text{Ohms}$ we have the line
impedance~\cite{Simons2004}
\begin{align}
  Z_0 &= \frac{1}{C_\text{air} v_\text{ph}} \\
    &= \frac{30 \pi}{\sqrt{(\epsilon_\text{r1}+1)/2}} \frac{K(k_0)}{K(k'_0)}
    \text{Ohms}
    \label{mws:eqn:Z0}
\end{align}
Note that the impedance of the waveguide has dependence only on the geometry in
the form of the ratio $k_0$, and the relative permittivity of the
substrate.~\cite{Simons2004} This means that for any substrate we choose the
value of $k_0$ can be chosen to fix the impedance at the standard $Z_0 =
\SI{50}{\ohm}$.

Therefore as long as $k_0$ is held constant the CPW can be tapered to change the
size of the centre conductor, and hence control the region the field occupies.

\subsection{CPW attenuation}

The electric field inside a CPW evolves according to
%
\begin{equation}
  \widetilde{E}(z) = \widetilde{E}(0)e^{-\gamma z}.
  \label{mws:eqn:Eloss}
\end{equation}
%
where $\gamma = \alpha + i\beta$, $\beta = 2\pi / \lambda$ is the wave
number and $\alpha$ is the attenuation constant.~\cite{Simons2004}
Taking the absolute value, the amplitude falls off as
%
\begin{equation}
  E(z) = E(0)e^{-\alpha z}.
\end{equation}

There are two contributing terms to the attenuation constant
%
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \alpha_d + \alpha_c,
\end{equation}
%
there are the contributions from dielectric and conductor respectively.
Negligible contributions from radiative losses are
neglected~\cite{Frankel1991}.  Bending losses can be neglected as long as
the radius of the bends are much larger than the wavelength of the propagating
wave. We must be mindful of this during design, since the typical wavelengths
for rotational transitions are on the order of centimeters.
We also do not consider the insertion loss of the resonator, since this does
not affect the quality factor~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3010859}.

\subsubsection{Dielectric losses}

Dielectric losses in the thick dielectric limit are described
by ~\cite{Collin2007}
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_d =
  \frac{\omega_0}{4c}\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}}}
  \tan \delta_e
\end{equation}
%
where $\tan\delta_e$ is the dielectric loss tangent. Common dielectrics for
microwave guides include aluminium nitride (\AlN{}) and high-resitivity
silicon.  For our purposes we wish to consider waveguides situated on
dielectrics layers that can be easily deposited above the trapping wires.
Following the work in \inlineref{Treutlein2008}, we primarily consider polyimide, which
can be despoitied by spoin-coating. Other options are available, such as
polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) ~\cite{WEI20169937}.

Typical values of dielectric constants and $\alpha_d$ are shown in
\mytableref{mws:table:diprops}. Note that these parameters have some dependence
on the frequency and temperature of the dielectric, and so are presented to
illustrate the amount of loss that can typically be expected for our experiment
at room temperature and frequencies in the \SI{10}{\giga\hertz} r\'egime.

\end{tabular}
\label{mws:table:diprops}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Conductor losses}

Conductor losses arise due to dissipation in the centre conductor and ground
plane of the CPW~\cite{Simons2004}.
The conductor attenuation constant is
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_c = \frac{R_c +R_g}{2Z_0}.
\end{equation}
Where $R_c$ and $R_g$ are the series resistances of the centre conductor and
the ground plance respectively.
For a waveguide with height 
$t$, theses are given by
\begin{equation}
  R_c = \frac{R_s}{4 S(1-k_0^2)K^2(k_0)}\left[ \pi + \log\left(\frac{4\pi
  S}{t}\right) - k_0\log\left(\frac{1+k_0}{1-k_0}\right) \right],
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  R_g = \frac{k_0 R_s}{4S(1-k_0^2)K^2(k_0)}\left[\pi +
  \log\left(\frac{4\pi(S+2W)}{t}\right) -
  \frac{1}{k_0}\log\left(\frac{1+k_0}{1-k_0}\right)\right].
\end{equation}
%

\mytableref{mws:table:metalprops}, and the computed conductor attenuations are
shown in \myfigref{mws:fig:conductorloss}.

    }
  \label{mws:fig:conductorloss}
\end{figure}

The conductor losses clearly dominate over the dielectric losses. For this
reason it is common to use superconductors for CPWs~\cite{}, since for a
superconductor $\sigma \to \infty$ and hence $R_s$ and $\alpha_c \to 0$.
This will not prevent the implementation of a microwave guide on a multi-layer
chip trap, but it will impact our ability to build incorporate a microwave
resonator as we will now discuss.

That said, it should be noted that the high loss will not prevent the use of
the CPW to directly drive microwave transitions in trapped molecules. This
would allow the same coherent control achieved in free space
experiments~\cite{WilliamsMagnetic2018} although realisation of the JCH will
clearly not be possible and a strong driving field may be required to overcome
losses.  With loss of $\alpha \approx \alpha_c$, and waveguides of lengths on
the scale of a few centimeter, we can expect a total loss of around
$\SI{400}{\neper\per\metre} \times \SI{0.01}{\metre} = \SI{35}{\decibel}$. This
should be sufficiently small that microwaves will be able to reach molecules
trapped on the chip.~\cite{Treutlein2008}

\subsection{CPW resonators}
\label{mws:resonators}

A microwave resonator can be formed from a section of CPW that is capacitively
coupled to another driving segment~\cite{Day2003}. The resonant frequency is
determined by the resonator's length, $L$, and the waveguide's phase
veloctiy~\cite{Simons2004}
%
\begin{equation}
  \omega_0 = \frac{\pi v_\text{ph}}{L} = \frac{\pi
  c}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\text{eff}} L}
\end{equation}
%
Microwaves can be coupled to the resonator by positioning the resonator inline
with a microwave guide, or in parallel as shown in \cm{some figure that I need
to make}. The strength of the coupling can be controlled by the shape of the
interface between the resonator and the waveguide~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3010859}

Recall from the discussion in chapter~\ref{theory} that for strong coupling we
require $Q > 1.7 \times 10^5$. The quality factors for CPW resonators can be
expressed in terms of an attenuation constant
%
\begin{equation}
  Q = \frac{\omega_0}{2c\alpha}.
  \label{mws:eqn:Qalpha}
\end{equation}
%
From \myfigref{mws:fig:conductorloss} and \mytableref{mws:table:diprops} it is
clear that without the use of superconductors, the attenuation will be
dominated by conductor losses, and $Q\sim10$. This is clearly not sufficient
for our purposes.

Conductor losses can be eliminated by use of a superconducting CPW. CPW
resonators are a developed technology, commonly used for coupling to
solid-state qubits~\cite{Wallraff2004}. Operating at the low temperatures
required for superconductors allows the achievement of very high quality
factors of order $10^6$~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3552890, Day2003}. For such devices
a low-loss dielectric is usually chosen for the substrate (sapphire being a
common choice) however a multi-layer resonator could potentially be achieved by
etching the polyimide in the slot gaps, as in \inlineref{920142}. Otherwise, a
single-layer superconducting design such as that shown in
\inlineref{Hattermann2017} could be adopted. Regardless, the multilayer design
remains a useful tool for prototyping a \cm{strong-coupling experiment.}
\cm{Rephrase this to stress that it might still work with resonator.}

% I have this point from Goppl that at low drive powers Q is somehow reduced. I
% don't understand this really, and don't think it's that relevant because we
% are so far off single-photon regime here anyway. But didn't want to entirely
% forget, so now this comment exists.

\section{Implementation of CPW-molecule coupling}
\label{mws:integrating}

Having established the CPW, and that such a device can operate on a polyimide
substrate, we can now consider the logistics of implementing such a device
with our design. In this section we will consider the \cm{states that we will
use} and \cm{how the transition frequency can be tuned to (or away from) the
resonator frequency}. We have already outlined how to fabricate a multi-layer device
in chapter~\ref{fab}, but the problem of delivering microwaves to the CPW
will also be discussed in this section.

% TODO Ensure this is introduced
For the remainder of this chapter we will consider microwave coupling to the
$\omega_0 = 2\pi \times \SI{20.5}{\giga\hertz}$ transition between the
stretched states, which was introduced in section~\ref{theory:molecules}.

\subsection{Stark shift}

Since the resonant frequency of the resonator is fixed by its length, it will
be useful to be able to tune the frequency of the molecule transition, either
to bring the molecules into or out of resonance with the microwaves. We
propose that this can be done by using the Stark shift due to a d.c.~field.
By positioning voltage-biased pads near to the molecule trap, the d.c.~field
can be used to shift the transition frequency.

When the shift is sufficiently small compared to the unperturbed energy, the
Stark shift can be found by second-order perturbation theory. The full
derivation can be found in, for example \inlineref{}, but for our purposes it
is sufficient to simply state the result, which is that the energy shift of the
% TODO Where do I introduce this notation?
rotational state is $\ket{N, m_N}$ is given by
% TODO Where do I introduce this energy rot notation?
%
\begin{equation} \Delta_{N, m_N} = \sum_{N', m_N'} \frac{(\mu_e
E)^2}{E_\text{rot}(N) - E_\text{rot}(N')} |\bra{N', m_N'}C_0^{(1)} \ket{N,
m_N}|^2.  \end{equation}
%
Where $C_q^{(k)}$ is a renormalised spherical harmonic, and the matrix element
here can be found by application of the Wigner-Eckart theorem~\cite{}.
% TODO Cite Mike's thing and Edmonds textbook
%
\begin{equation} \bra{N', m_N'}C_0^{(1)} \ket{N, m_N} =
  (-1)^{m_N'}\sqrt{(2N+1)(2N'+1)}
  % 3 j symbols
  \begin{pmatrix} N' & 1 & N \\ -m_N' & 0 & m_N \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
N' & 1 & N \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \end{equation}
%
where the last two matrices represent the usual 3j-symbols.


The summation can be simplified when we note that the properties of 3j-symbols
mean that mixing only ocurrs between states where $m_N' = m_N$ and $N=N'$. It
is simple to compute the resulting energy shift for arbitrary states, and the
results are shown for $N=0, 1, 2$ \CaF{} states in \myfigref{mws:fig:stark}. We
note that for small field strengths it is possible to induce a transition shift
of several gigahertz with a modest electric field strength. We anticipate that
only shifts on the order of $<\SI{1}{\mega\hertz}$ will be required in
experiment, and for such small perturbations, any additional effects of mixing
hyperfine states, or effects due to the magnetic field can be ignored.

The chip flange (shown in \myfigref{overview:figs:chipexperiment}) has been
designed to incorporate MCD Precision's SMA45-GS-WLED \SI{2.92}{\milli\meter}
high-frequency SMA feedthroughs. These welded connectors can be used to bring
microwaves inside the chip chamber, where they can be launched onto a CPW on
the subchip. Microwaves will be transfered through from the feedthrough to the
subchip using a SMA male-male barrel adapter from Pasternak, and a female-clamp
PCB launcher from Pasternack. The launching assembly can be seen in
\mysubfigref{mws:fig:implement}{a}. These components have been tested for UHV
compatability, as discussed in \cm{reference relevant chapter}.  The flange
assembly has been designed to allow microwaves to exit the chamber, where they
can be terminated or measured.

Once launched onto the subchip, the microwaves will be delivered by CPW to the
subchip. 
%
As discussed in chapter~\ref{} the subchip in its current form is \cm{an
aluminium-core PCB}, however in future iterations of the experiment this can be
replaced with, for example, an Arlon AD1000 board, which will be a suitable
carrier for both trapping currents and microwaves~\cite{Morgan2020}. 
%
The subchip CPW will be connected to the \cm{science chip} CPW by wire-bonds.
These can be chosen to be arbitrarily large s that it is easy to make good
connection with the wire bonds, and then tapered down to reduce the field size
while maintaining the same $k_0$ and hence the same impedance. This CPW can be
capacitively coupled to a microwave resonator, but for a simple example we show
a multi-layer design for a single CPW in \mysubfigref{mws:fig:implement}{b}.

To form an even smaller trap than discussed above, the CPW centre conductor can
be biased, to create a dimple trap along with the underlying axis of the
Z-wire, as was done in \inlineref{Treutlein2008}. For a resonator it would also
be possible to introduce a bias field, but this would have to be done on-chip
with a band stop filter~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.4808364}. This could also be used
to implement the electrostatic traps described in \inlineref{Andre2006}.

\section{Sideband cooling}

This subsection summarises the sideband cooling scheme presented in
\inlineref{Andre2006} and presents cooling rates for our trapping scheme with
\CaF{}.  Throughout section we assume that we operate with a single molecule
coupled to a high-quality cavity ($Q\sim10^6$, $\kappa \approx
2\pi\times \SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}$) in the
strong coupling r\'egime ($g\sim10^5>Q$)

In the macroscopic magnetic trap, the
$\ket{e}\rightarrow\ket{g}$ decay is very slow ($\Gamma \sim
10^{-5}\si{hertz}$), but when a molecule is in close proximity to a microwave
resonator at the transition frequency, the decay rate is strongly enhanced. 
with rate
%
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_c = \frac{\kappa}{2}.
\end{equation}

This enhanced decay rate opens the door to sideband cooling into the motional
ground state of the trap.
%
We write the state of the molecule as $\ket{N, m}$ where $N\in\{e,g\}$ is the
rotational state of the molecule, and $m$ is the quantum number of the motion
in the trap. For any ground state $\ket{g,m}$ there is a carrier frequency
transition to $\ket{e, m}$ at the resonant frequency $\omega_0$, and sidebands
to the $\ket{e, m+m'}$ states at frequency $\omega_0 + m'\omega_t$, where
$\omega_t$ is the trap frequency and $m'\in \mathbb{Z}$. There are similar
carrier and sideband transitions for $\ket{e,m} \rightarrow \ket{g, m+m'}$.

We imagine that an external driving field is applied on the
$\ket{g, m} \rightarrow \ket{e, m-1}$ sideband as pictured in
\myfigref{mws:fig:sideband}. Combined with the enhanced decay, this allows
sideband cooling into low motional ground states of the trap. The molecule will
be transfered by the driving field into a lower motional state, and will
rapidly decay into the ground state by releasing a photon into the resonator.
Each time this happens the molecule's energy is reduced by $\hbar\omega_t$.
This results in a cooling rate
%
\begin{equation}
  R_\text{sbc} = \frac{\hbar\Gamma_c\omega_t}{k_B}.
\end{equation}


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering

    allowing sideband cooling to low motional states.

    }
    \label{mws:fig:sbtemps}
\end{figure}

As per discussion in section~\ref{theory:chips}, we expect typical trap
frequencies $\omega_t\sim 2\pi \times 10^5 \si{\hertz}$ and therefore the
cooling rate will be of order \SI{10}{\milli\kelvin\per\second}. This is shown
for a molecule in a dimple trap (\cm{reference theory section on dimple traps
not yet written}) at various trapping currents in
\mysubfigref{mws:fig:sbtemps}{a}.

The lowest motional state that can be reached is determined by the background
photon number in the resonator. A typical high-$Q$ cavity will operate at a few
tens of millikelvin~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3010859} but these temperatures require
a dilution fridge, and high-temperature superconductors can operate at typical
cryocooler temperatures of $T_\text{res}=\SI{4}{\kelvin}$. This corresponds
to a background photon number of
%
\begin{equation}
  \overline{m} = \frac{k_B T_\text{res}}{\hbar \omega_0}.
\end{equation}
%
It has been commonly shown that other sources of background photons can be
eliminated~\cite{Wallraff2004}, in particular it can be useful to filter
high-frequency photons that can enter from the input
ports~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3638063}. 

We expect the minimum temperature achievable by sideband cooling to be reached
when the molecule motion and photon energy are in thermal equilibirum, so that
%
\begin{equation}
  T_\text{min} = \frac{\hbar \omega_t \overline{m}}{k_B}
\end{equation}
%
which is shown as a function of the trapping current for various resonator
temperatures in \mysubfigref{mws:fig:sbtemps}{b}. Note that reducing the
trapping current will reduce the trap frequency, and hence also the lowest
temperate that can be achieved. \cm{Is this meaningful?}

\section{Entangling light and photon states}

Reference~\cite{Andre2006} also proposes entangling the molecule state with the
quantum state of photons in the resonator. This is inspired by the methodology
of \inlineref{PhysRevA.69.062320} where the state of a Cooper-pair box is
entangled with a resonator state. This entanglement can be used to perform
state readout, state preparation and coupling to neighbouring qubits. In this
section we will mainly discuss state readout, since this framework will be
useful in the next chapter.
%
% TODO Bring in any more necessary cites (from squeeze ch)

Entangling of the light and molecule state can be achieved in the dispersive
r\'egime, where the transition frequency is tuned so that $|\Delta|\gg g$.
Reference~\cite{PhysRevA.69.062320} tells us that we can gain insight into the
dispersive behaviour by applying the unitary transformation
%
\begin{equation}
  U = \exp \left[\frac{g}{\Delta}(a\sigma_+ - a^\dagger\sigma_-)\right]
  \label{mws:eqn:Utransform}
\end{equation}
%
to the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian described in section~\ref{theory:QO}. With
expansion up to second order in $g/\Delta$, we obtain
%
\begin{equation} H= UH_\text{JC}U^\dagger \approx \hbar \omega_c
  a^\dagger a + \hbar\left(\omega_c +
  \frac{g^2}{\Delta}\right)s_z + \frac{\hbar
  g^2}{\Delta}\sigma_z a^\dagger a.
  \label{mws:eqn:UHU}
\end{equation}
%
% TODO Probably better to start with s_i in theory
Here we have introduced the spin operator $s_i = \sigma_i/2$.

The three terms of $H$ describe the oscillation of light in the cavity, the energy
of the spin and the interaction of the photons with the spin. Note that the
interaction of the photons and the spins induces the usual AC start shift
proportional to $(n+\frac{1}{2})$. The last term allows the pefromance of 
QND measurement, since it will enable exchange of information
between the z-component of the spin with the photons.

We take the state of the photons in the resonator to be in a canonical coherent
state~\cite{Gazeau2009}
%
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\alpha} = e^{-\frac{|\alpha|^2}{2}}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\alpha^n}{\sqrt{n!}} \ket{n}
\end{equation}
%
% TODO Wording here, again representing? Was it before? Is it clear?
% Should I change n to m (including above) for consistency?
with $\alpha\in\mathbb{C}$, and $\ket{n}$ again representing the $n^\text{th}$
Fock state of the light~\cite{agarwal2012}. For such a state $|\alpha|^2$ is
the average photon number, with $a^\dagger a$ being the number operator such
that $\bra{\alpha}a^\dagger a \ket{\alpha} = |\alpha|^2$.

The interaction of the light with the molecule is desribed by the last term in
$H$, so for an interaction over time $T$, we have
%
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\Psi(T)} = \exp\left(-iH_\text{int}T/\hbar\right)\ket{\Psi(0)}
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
  H_\text{int} = \hbar \frac{g^2}{\Delta} s_z a^\dagger a
\end{equation}
%
and $\ket{\Psi(0) = \ket{\psi}\ket{\alpha}}$ is the state of the system at the
time of measurement. This can be expanded by inserting the definition of the
coherent and molecule states,
%
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\Psi(T)} = e^{-\frac{|\alpha|^2}{2}}\sum_{n=0}^\infty
   \frac{\alpha^n}{\sqrt{n!}} e^{-i\nu T s_z a^\dagger a} \ket{n} (\cos\theta
   \ket{g} + e^{i\phi}\sin\theta\ket{e})
   \label{mws:eqn:evolve1}
\end{equation}
%
where $\nu = g^2/\Delta$.
Now the number operator in the exponent acts on $\ket{n}$, and the spin
operator acts on $\ket{N}$ for
%
\begin{equation}
   \ket{\Psi(T)} = e^{-\frac{|\alpha|^2}{2}}\sum_{n=0}^\infty
   \frac{\alpha^n}{\sqrt{n!}} (e^{i\nu T n \hbar/2}\cos\theta\ket{n}\ket{g} +
   e^{-i\nu T n \hbar/2}e^{i\phi}\sin\theta\ket{n}\ket{e}).
\end{equation}
%
Collecting the coefficients of the molecule states yields
%
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\Psi(T)} = \cos\theta\left(e^{-\frac{|\alpha|^2}{2}}\sum_{n=0}^\infty
   \frac{(\alpha e^{i\nu T \hbar/2})^n}{\sqrt{n!}}\ket{n}\right)\ket{g} +  
    e^{i\phi}\sin\theta\left(e^{-\frac{|\alpha|^2}{2}}\sum_{n=0}^\infty
   \frac{(\alpha e^{-i\nu T \hbar/2})^n}{\sqrt{n!}}\ket{n}\right)\ket{e}.
\end{equation}
%
Finally, note that each of the photon states (in parentheses) defines a
coherent state, so the resulting state after interaction is
%
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\Psi(T)} = \cos\theta\ket{\alpha_+}\ket{g} +
  e^{i\phi}\sin\theta\ket{\alpha_-}\ket{e}
  \label{mws:eqn:entangled}
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha_\pm = \alpha \exp(\pm i \nu T \hbar/2)$.

\subsection{State readout}
\label{mws:readout}

The state of the molecule is now entangled with the state of the light in such
a way that measuring the phase of the light will perform a readout of the
molecule state. In this subsection I will present the homodyne
measurement~\cite{agarwal2012} technique in the context of performing a
measurement of our molecule state.

The homodyne measurement is illustrated in \myfigref{mws:fig:homodyne}. The
light to be measured, here labelled $\ket{\Psi_a}$, is incident on one port (a)
of a beam splitter. On the other port (b) we have a strong local oscillator in
a coherent state $\ket{\beta}$, with large amplitude, in this case meaning that
$|\beta| \gg |\alpha|$. We set the relative phases of $\ket{\alpha}$ and
$\ket{\beta}$ so that $\arg{\alpha}=0$ and $\arg{\beta}=-\varphi$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figs/mws/homodyne.pdf}
  \caption{Schematic of a homodyne measurement. The state to be measured
    $\ket{\Psi_a}$ is incident on port (a) of the beamsplitter, and the local
    oscillator $\ket{\beta}$ is incident on port (b). The signal from
    photodiodes at the output ports is summed to produce a homodyne
    measurement.
  }
  \label{mws:fig:homodyne}
\end{figure}

The annihilation operators associated with the input ports are related to those
of the output ports (c and d) by the usual relation for a balanced beam
splitter~\cite{agarwal2012}
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{squeeze:eqn:bsmat}
  \begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & i \\ i & 1 
  \end{pmatrix}  \begin{pmatrix} a' \\ b \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
%
Here $a'$ represents the annihilation operator of light arriving at the (a)
port of the beamsplitter. In our experiment this will be the light that is
emitted from the resonator, which has annihilation operator
$a'=\sqrt{\kappa}a$~\cite{Vanner16182}.
%
% TODO I need to find better cite, could also cite Blais and that might be
% enough?

The difference in the expected photon numbers arriving at each
detector is therefore
%
\begin{align}
  \langle c^\dagger c - d^\dagger d\rangle &= i\langle a'^\dagger b-
  a'b^\dagger \rangle \\
  &= i \kappa \bra{\Psi_a}\bra{\beta}(a^\dagger b-
  ab^\dagger)\ket{\beta}\ket{\Psi_a} \\
  & = i|\beta|\kappa \bra{\Psi_a}(a^\dagger e^{i\varphi} - a
  e^{-i\varphi})\ket{\Psi_a}.
\end{align}
%
We now intoduce the canonical quadratures of the light field, corresponding to
its real and imaginary parts. They are defined by~\cite{gerry_knight_2004}
%
\begin{align}
  X = \frac{a + a^\dagger}{2} && Y = \frac{a - a^\dagger}{2i}.
\end{align}
%
The expected photon difference is now
\begin{equation}
  \langle c^\dagger c - d^\dagger d\rangle =
  2|\beta|\kappa\bra{\Psi_a}(Y\cos\varphi - X\sin\varphi)\ket{\Psi_a} \\
  \label{squeeze:eqn:homoquads}
\end{equation}

% TODO Need to account for transmission coefficient but probably later, see
% Mauro's paper (Q. Tomography), eqn. 2.37 - 2.42
Hence measuring the intensity of each output of the beamsplitter can give us
information on the phase of the light. We choose $\varphi = 0$ so that the
measurement is of the $Y$ quadrature, i.e.\ we measure the imaginary part of
$\ket{\Psi_a}$
%
\begin{equation}
  \langle c^\dagger c - d^\dagger d\rangle =  2\kappa
  |\alpha||\beta|\left\langle\sin(\nu T s_z)\right\rangle.
\end{equation}
%
For a short pulse of light, the interrogation time will be the lifetime of the
photons in the cavity, $T = \kappa^{-1}$. In this r\'egime we can expand sine
to first order, so that
%
\begin{equation}
  \langle c^\dagger c - d^\dagger d\rangle = 2|\alpha||\beta|
  \frac{g^2}{\Delta}\langle s_z\rangle.
  \label{mws:eqn:homomeas}
\end{equation}
%
% TODO This isn't really a spin state, need to make this more clear above
In other words, the expectation value of the photon measurement is linked
directly to that of the molecule's state. A measurement of $\langle c^\dagger c
- d^\dagger d\rangle$ will also measure $s_z$. This allows for readout of the
spin state via the microwave ports.

For this readout procedure, we have made the assumptions that we are operating
in the dispersive r\'egime ($|\Delta| \gg g$) but in the final step
(\myeqref{mws:eqn:homomeas} the expansion of sine require a stricter condition,
that 
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{g^2}{\Delta\kappa} \ll 1.
\end{equation}
%
The detuning required for our $g$ and $Q$ is therefore
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\Delta}{2 \pi} \gg \SI{250}{\kilo\hertz}.
\end{equation}
%
Which translates to a field strength of \cm{need to figure out Stark effect and
say something about the distance between the shifting plates.}

\subsection{State preparation}

The engtangling of the molecule and light state will produce a powerful system
with applications beyond simple state readout. First, the system can be used to
produce Schr\"odinger cat states in the light field~\cite{Andre2006}. This can be achieved
by pulsing the microwaves to produce the entangled state in
\myeqref{mws:eqn:entangled}. Expressing the molecule state in the $x$ basis
$\ket{\pm} = (\ket{g} \pm \ket{e})/2$, this becomes
%
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\Psi(T)} = \ket{\Alpha_+(\theta, \phi) }\ket{+} + \ket{\Alpha_-(\theta,
  \phi)}\ket{-}
\end{equation}
%
with
%
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\Alpha_\pm(\theta, \phi)} = \cos\theta\ket{\alpha_+} \pm
  e^{i\phi}\sin\theta\ket{\alpha_-}.
\end{equation}
%
Now independent measurement of the molecule state in the $x$ basis will yield
$\ket{\pm}$, heralding the creation of the $\ket{\Alpha_\pm(\theta, \phi)}$
Schr\"odinger cat state in the light field. This is an attractive method for
producing such states in the microwave r\'egime, in analogy to what has
previously been achieved using visible light~\cite{Hacker2019}.

\subsection{Coupling between molecules}

As reported in \inlineref{Andre2006}, the entanglement can also be used to
couple between molecules trapped near the same resonator. We write the state of
the two molecules as $\ket{\Psi}_i$, $i\in\{1,2\}$, with the detunings
individually controlled labelled $\Delta_i$. Molecule $1$ can be addressed
independently of $2$ by setting $\Delta_2 >> \Delta_1$ and visa versa. 

When $\Delta_1 = \Delta_2$ the interaction Hamiltonian between the two
molecules can be found by adiabatic elimination of the photon state to
be~\cite{Andre2006}
%
\begin{equation}
  H_\text{int} = \hbar \frac{g^2}{\Delta} (\sigma_+^1\sigma_-^2 +
  \sigma_-^1\sigma_+^2)
\end{equation}
%
where $\sigma^i_k$ is the $\sigma_k$ operator acting on the
$i^\text{th}$ molecule. It can be shown that such an interaction can be used to
implement high-fidelity two-qubit operation on a chip~\cite{Andre2006}.

\cm{Would be good to find some other cites for this part}
