\cm{
In chapter (probably the introduction) I introduced the concept of microwave
guides integrated into chip traps. Previous experiments have used on-chip
microave guides to couple to \cm{(I think this is right)} the hyperfine structure
of atoms. However, the coupling to heteronuclear dipolar molecules is much
stronger \cm{Why?}. In the strong coupling regime it may be possible to \cm{(do
cavity QED, sideband cooling, etc...)}

\section{The coplanar waveguide}

\cm{The following is mostly from my ESA so will need editing! Important
takeaways are the field strcutre, where the molecules need to sit in this
field, and what we need to do to get a cavity. What can we do if we don't have
a cavity?}

The coplanar waveguide (CPW) was originally proposed by Cheng P.~Wen as a
means of guiding microwaves across the surface of a dielectric
substrate~\cite{1127105}. It consists of a central conductor with a ground
plane on either side, as pictured in~\myfigref{mws:fig:CPW}. CPWs have become
prolific, since they allow the creation of robust microwave devices, and offer
some benefits over other waveguide \cm{architectures} such as the stipline
waveguide because they can provide circularly polarised fields, and also
provide easy access to the ground plane for shunt connections.

The CPW's geometry is defined by the centre conductor width ($S$) and the
channel width ($W$). The height of the conductor is $t$ and the dielectric
height is $h$. 
The geometry of the CPW determines the region the
microwave field occupies, as illustrated in \myfigref{experiment:fig:CPWfield}.
The CPW can therefore be designed to maximise overlap between the microwave
field and a cloud of molecules trapped nearby.  As a rough approximation the
molecules should be trapped at a distance $h\sim S$ above the centre of the CPW
to achieve a good overlap.~\cite{Boehi2009} The field surrounding the CPW is
shwon in \mysubfigref{mws:fig:CPW}{b}, the equations defining this field can be
found analytically~\cite{Simons2004}, or the field can be determined by a
finite-element simulation.

% dielectirc compared to conductor height

\end{figure}

\subsection{CPW properties}

We will now consider the electric properties of a CPW. These will largely
depend on the the planar geometry of the waveguide, which we express in terms
of the ratio~\cite{1127105, Simons2004}
%
\begin{equation}
  k_0 = \frac{S}{S+2W} = \sqrt{1-{k'_0}^2}
  \label{eqn:k0def}
\end{equation}
%
For a waveguide made of a material with conductivity $\sigma$
and permeability $\mu$ and propagating field with frequency $\omega$
there is a skin depth~\cite{Simons2004}
%
\begin{equation}
  \delta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega\mu\sigma}}
\end{equation}
%
and skin effect surface resistance~\cite{Simons2004}
%
\begin{equation}
  R_s = \frac{1}{\sigma\delta}.
\end{equation}

Since the field of the CPW will pass through both the dielectric and the
surrouding air, the CPW's capacitance is the sum of the capacitance of each of
these two parts
%
\begin{equation}
  C_\text{CPW} = C_\text{dielectic} + C_\text{air}.
\end{equation}
%
The method of finding these individual contributions is somewhat involved, so
we simply state the results here in terms of the elliptic integral of the
first kind $K(k)$~\cite{Simons2004}. The capacitance due to the dielectric is
%
%
\begin{equation}
  C_\text{dielectric} = 2\epsilon_0(\epsilon_\text{r1}-1)\frac{K(k_0)}{K(k'_0)}
\end{equation}
%
and the capacitance of the air region is
%
\begin{equation}
  C_\text{air} = 4\epsilon_0 \frac{K(k_0)}{K(k'_0)}.
\end{equation}

We can use this to find the effective permittivity~\cite{Simons2004}
%
\begin{align}
  \epsilon_\text{eff} &= \frac{C_\text{dielectric}}{C_\text{air}} \\
    &= \frac{1+ \epsilon_\text{r1}}{2} \\
\end{align}
%
where we have assumed that we are in the limit of a thick dielectric layer ($h
\gg W$ so that most of the field density is inside the dielectric.
%
The phase velocity (using $c$ as the speed of light) is~\cite{Simons2004}
%
\begin{align}
  v_\text{ph} &= \frac{c}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\text{eff}}} \\
    &= \frac{c}{\sqrt{(1 + \epsilon_\text{r1})/2}}.
\end{align}

Now using the approximation~\cite{Collin2007}
$\sqrt{\mu_0/\epsilon_0}\approx120\pi\text{Ohms}$ we have the line
impedance~\cite{Simons2004}
\begin{align}
  Z_0 &= \frac{1}{C_\text{air} v_\text{ph}} \\
    &= \frac{30 \pi}{\sqrt{(\epsilon_\text{r1}+1)/2}} \frac{K(k_0)}{K(k'_0)}
    \text{Ohms}
    \label{mws:eqn:Z0}
\end{align}
Note that the impedance of the waveguide has dependence only on the geometry in
the form of the ratio $k_0$, and the relative permittivity of the
substrate.~\cite{Simons2004} This means that for any substrate we choose the
value of $k_0$ can be chosen to fix the impedance at the standard $Z_0 =
\SI{50}{\ohm}$.

Therefore as long as $k_0$ is held constant the CPW can be tapered to change the
size of the centre conductor, and hence control the region the field occupies.

\subsection{CPW attenuation}

The electric field inside a CPW evolves according to
%
\begin{equation}
  \widetilde{E}(z) = \widetilde{E}(0)e^{-\gamma z}.
  \label{mws:eqn:Eloss}
\end{equation}
%
where $\gamma = \alpha + i\beta$, $\beta = 2\pi / \lambda$ is the wave
number and $\alpha$ is the attenuation constant.~\cite{Simons2004}
Taking the absolute value, the amplitude falls off as
%
\begin{equation}
  E(z) = E(0)e^{-\alpha z}.
\end{equation}

There are two contributing terms to the attenuation constant
%
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \alpha_d + \alpha_c,
\end{equation}
%
there are the contributions from dielectric and conductor respectively.
Negligible contributions from radiative losses are
neglected~\cite{Frankel1991}.  Bending losses can be neglected as long as
the radius of the bends are much larger than the wavelength of the propagating
wave. We must be mindful of this during design, since the typical wavelengths
for rotational transitions are on the order of centimeters.

\cm{Fix, there is a bit about this in Goppl}
We also do not consider the insertion loss of the
resonator, since this does not affect the quality
factor~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3010859}.

\subsubsection{Dielectric losses}

Dielectric losses in the thick dielectric limit are described
by ~\cite{Collin2007}
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_d =
  \frac{\omega_0}{4c}\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{r1}}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}}}
  \tan \delta_e
\end{equation}
%
where $\tan\delta_e$ is the dielectric loss tangent. Common dielectrics for
microwave guides include aluminium nitride (\AlN{}) and high-resitivity
silicon.  For our purposes we wish to consider waveguides situated on
dielectrics layers that can be easily deposited above the trapping wires.
Following the work in \inlineref{Treutlein2008}, we primarily consider polyimide, which
can be despoitied by spoin-coating. Other options are available, such as
polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) ~\cite{WEI20169937}.

Typical values of dielectric constants and $\alpha_d$ are shown in
\mytableref{mws:table:diprops}. Note that these parameters have some dependence
on the frequency and temperature of the dielectric, and so are presented to
illustrate the amount of loss that can typically be expected for our experiment
at room temperature and frequencies in the \SI{10}{\giga\hertz} r\'egime.

\end{tabular}
\label{mws:table:diprops}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Conductor losses}

Conductor losses arise due to dissipation in the centre conductor and ground
plane of the CPW~\cite{Simons2004}.
The conductor attenuation constant is
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_c = \frac{R_c +R_g}{2Z_0}.
\end{equation}
Where $R_c$ and $R_g$ are the series resistances of the centre conductor and
the ground plance respectively.
For a waveguide with height 
$t$, theses are given by
\begin{equation}
  R_c = \frac{R_s}{4 S(1-k_0^2)K^2(k_0)}\left[ \pi + \log\left(\frac{4\pi
  S}{t}\right) - k_0\log\left(\frac{1+k_0}{1-k_0}\right) \right],
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  R_g = \frac{k_0 R_s}{4S(1-k_0^2)K^2(k_0)}\left[\pi +
  \log\left(\frac{4\pi(S+2W)}{t}\right) -
  \frac{1}{k_0}\log\left(\frac{1+k_0}{1-k_0}\right)\right].
\end{equation}
%

\mytableref{mws:table:metalprops}, and the computed conductor attenuations are
shown in \myfigref{mws:fig:conductorloss}.

    }
  \label{mws:fig:conductorloss}
\end{figure}

The conductor losses clearly dominate over the dielectric losses. For this
reason it is common to use superconductors for CPWs~\cite{}, since for a
superconductor $\sigma \to \infty$ and hence $R_s$ and $\alpha_c \to 0$.
This will not prevent the implementation of a microwave guide on a multi-layer
chip trap, but it will impact our ability to build incorporate a microwave
resonator as we will now discuss.

\subsection{CPW resonators}
\label{mws:resonators}

We discussed in chapter~\ref{theory} that strong-coupling between a microwave
resonator and a trapped molecule has the potential to be a powerful tool for
\cm{new physics}. These proposals will be explored further in the next section, but
first we present how a microwave resonator can be implemented with a CPW.

A microwave resonator can be formed from a section of CPW that is capacitively
coupled to another driving segment~\cite{Day2003}. The resonant frequency is
determined by the resonator's length, $L$, and the waveguide's phase
veloctiy~\cite{Simons2004}
%
\begin{equation}
  \omega_0 = \frac{\pi v_\text{ph}}{L} = \frac{\pi
  c}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\text{eff}} L}
\end{equation}
%
Microwaves can be coupled to the resonator by positioning the resonator inline
with a microwave guide, or in parallel as shown in \cm{some figure that I need
to make}. The strength of the coupling can be controlled by the shape of the
interface between the resonator and the waveguide~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3010859}

Recall from the discussion in chapter~\ref{theory} that for strong coupling we
require $Q > 1.7 \times 10^5$. The quality factors for CPW resonators can be
expressed in terms of an attenuation constant
%
\begin{equation}
  Q = \frac{\omega_0}{2c\alpha}.
  \label{mws:eqn:Qalpha}
\end{equation}
%
From \myfigref{mws:fig:conductorloss} and \mytableref{mws:table:diprops} it is
clear that without the use of superconductors, the attenuation will be
dominated by conductor losses, and $Q\sim10$. This is clearly not sufficient
for our purposes.

Conductor losses can be eliminated by use of a superconducting CPW. CPW
resonators are a developed technology, commonly used for coupling to
solid-state qubits~\cite{Wallraff2004}. Operating at the low temperatures
required for superconductors allows the achievement of very high quality
factors of order $10^6$~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3552890, Day2003}. For such devices
a low-loss dielectric is usually chosen for the substrate (sapphire being a
common choice) however a multi-layer resonator could potentially be achieved by
etching the polyimide in the slot gaps, as in \inlineref{920142}. Otherwise, a
single-layer superconducting design such as that shown in
\inlineref{Hattermann2017} could be adopted. Regardless, the multilayer design
remains a useful tool for prototyping a \cm{strong-coupling experiment.}

% I have this point from Goppl that at low drive powers Q is somehow reduced. I
% don't understand this really, and don't think it's that relevant because we
% are so far off single-photon regime here anyway. But didn't want to entirely
% forget, so now this comment exists.

\section{Integrating microwave structures on a chip}
\label{mws:integrating}

That said, it should be noted that the high loss should not prevent us from
using the CPW to directly drive microwave transitions in trapped molecules, as
we will still be able to pass signal through the waveguide without the need to
construct a resonator. With loss of $\alpha \approx \alpha_c$, and waveguides of
lengths on the scale of a few centimeter, we can expect a total loss of around
$\SI{400}{\neper\per\metre} \times \SI{0.01}{\metre} = \SI{35}{\decibel}$. This
should be sufficiently small that microwaves will be able to reach molecules
trapped on the chip.~\cite{Treutlein2008}
One of the later goals of the project will be to characterise microwave losses
on the chip and compare these with those expected from theory.
%
\cm{I might be able to expand on this further down the line, but it seems
unnecessary to include now. Maybe need a fig. to explain too?
%
\emph{
A consequence of being unable to implement a microwave resonator is that it
becomes challenging to implement the electrostatic trap proposed by Andr\'e et
al.~\cite{Andre2006} as this relied on the ability to introduce a bias voltage
on the centre conductor of the resonator in order to form the trap. It is
possible to bias the centre conductor (as detailed in
reference~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.3573824}) but it is not possible to do the same
for a waveguide.
}}


% TODO
\cm{This is from the ESA, so need to fix up}

\cm{Mike:This bit doesn't make sense to me. The logic here seems to imply that
the  electrostatic trap relies on a resonator but the magnetic trap doesn't.
Which isn't true!  We chose the magnetic trap because we think it will give us
longer coherence times. \\
%
Cameron: I think my reasoning here glossed over the details from the COMSOL
models Kyle made for brining the bias onto the chip. I thought our conclusion
was that the electrostatic trap required a resonator to bring the bias in, but
maybe I am wrong? Mike has probably forgotten this, and a new reader wouldn't
know it to start with, so I need to figure out how best to explain myself. Maybe
forget the bias stuff and just argue that magentically insensetive transitions
lead to long coherence times, which is what we want.
}

As the microwave attenuation prevents implementation of a resonator (and hence
implementation of an electrostatic trap integrated with the waveguide) another
solution for trapping and control of the microwaves must be found. Since
magnetic trapping of atoms above a chip has been extensively researched (see
section~\ref{chiptraps}), we have chosen this mechanism for trapping of molecules
above the chip.

Various possible geometries for combining magnetic trapping wires and a CPW have
been extensively explored. It transpires that it is extremely challenging to
construct a geometry with both of these on the same layer that achieves a
satisfactory overlap between the CPW field and the trapping region. To get
around this, a chip with two layers has been designed: the lower layer consists
of an array of DC trapping wires, and an upper layer hosts the CPW. The two are
to be separated by an insulating layer of resin.

Multi-layer chips have been constructed before, notably those by
Treutlein~\cite{Treutlein2008} and B\"ohi~\cite{rohtua}, whose work has heavily
inspired our design. Treutlein and B\"ohi used photolithography followed by
electroplating to create the lower layer (see section \ref{chiptraps:wiretraps})
then formed the insulating layer by spin-coating polyimide resin in several
stages. This allows the creation of a smooth layer, effectively covering bumps
that can be formed from the underlying wires which avoids significant
discontinuities in the waveguide.

Polyimide is used as the resin as it is highly resistant to cleaning techniques
commonly used in photolithography, including piranha clean.  It is also
effective as a microwave substrate~\cite{Simons2004} \cm{Mike seems concerned
about this being high}
($\epsilon_\mathrm{r1} = 3.3$, $\tan\delta_e = 0.016$) with conductor losses
still dominating those caused by the dielectric.

\cm{Alex: were these the limits or the max they used?}
Using a multi-layer chip introduces thermal constraints on the currents that can
flow through the trapping wires. Current densities achieved by Treutlein and
B\"ohi \cite{} were \SI{2.8E10}{\ampere\per\metre\squared} in the upper layer and
\SI{5.5E10}{\ampere\per\metre\squared} in the lower layer.
