The chip apparatus was assembled for preliminary tests, but isolated from the 
main \CaF{} experiment. This modest setup was useful for a variety of
measurements, which will be discussed below, including vacuum compatibility,
current testing under vacuum, and looking at the amount of background scatter
from the apparatus during imaging.

\section{Experiment assembly}

The chip flange assembly which was introduced at the end of
chapter~\ref{overview} is shown in \myfigref{exper:fig:flange} (see also
\mysubfigref{overview:fig:chipchamber}{b}). It is designed
to hold the chip in position for loading \CaF{}, whilst also providing current
delivery and heat sinking.

\end{figure}

The copper heat sink is mounted to the flange using screws where the thread has
been partially removed. This is done to precent any trapped gas causing virtual
leaks inside the chamber. The heat sink supports the subchip and also incorporates the large
U-trap, which is recessed beneath the chip. It is electrically isolated from
the heat sink by \AlN{} plates. This material is chosen since it is an
electrical insulator, but will still allow the conduction of heat away from the
U-wire. The subchip is attached to the heat sink with metal screws. Since the
conductor tracks are at points very close to the mounting holes, we isolate the
screws from the surface using polyimide washers, which were made in the
Imperial workshop.

\section{Background-free imaging}

\cm{Normally we just image with 606nm light and do light-induced fluorescence
imaging, but this creates a load of scatter which reduces SNR.}

One possible method of reducing background whilst imaging molecules is Raman
Resonance Optical Cycling (RROC), an background-free imaging scheme recently
proposed and demonstrated using \SrF{} in \inlineref{Shaw2021}. In this scheme,
off-diagonal ($v\neq v'$) vibrational transitions are driven to excite the
molecule, which will decay primarily on the diagonal ($v=v'$) transitions. The
off-diagonal transitions are separated from the diagonal ones by
$>\SI{10}{\tera\hertz}$, and so it is possible to use a bandpass filter to
exclude the imaging light from any measurement. For an ideal bandpass filter
this would remove any background from imaging light scattered by the apparatus.

Reference~\cite{Shaw2021} reports a suppersion of scattered light by a factor
of $\sim10^6$, and an average emission of 20 photons per molecule. In this
experiment, a beam of molecules was imaged, and this emission is limited by the
interaction time during travel. For imaging a stationary cloud of molecules we
would expect instead to be limited by the reduced scattering rate in the
off-diagaonal transitions. In this section I will \cm{either just describe the
technique, or do this and show some results (fat chance...)}

\subsection{Implementation in \CaF{}}

% TODO Show name and model of bandpass filter

This scheme for \CaF{} is shown in \myfigref{exper:fig:bgfreelevels}. The
\pewpew{}{01} and \pewpew{}{10} light is used to drive the transitions at
\SI{585}{\nano\meter} and \SI{628}{\nano\meter} respectively (see
\mytableref{overview:table:lasers}). Fluorescenc from the decay on the
\SI{606}{\nano\meter} transitions $v'=0\rightarrow v=0$ and $v'=1\rightarrow
v=1$ is isolated by a bandpassfilter, and can be imaged without the usual
background scatter.
