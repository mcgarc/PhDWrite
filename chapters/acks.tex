Thanks go to all who supported this work: my supervisors Mike Tarbutt and Ben
Sauer; Kyle Jarvis, who designed the holding-chip, undertook many COMSOL
simulations of CPWs and helped in uncountable other ways; Bharath Srivathsan is
still relatively new to the project, but has already been of enormous help. I
must also mention Sanja Maricic and Miranda Smith, who have been incredibly
patient with my various inane requests.
