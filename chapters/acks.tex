If I did one thing right during my PhD it was choosing my supervisors. Ben, you
are a font of infinite wisdom in the lab, and have tolerated my bush-league
attempts at lab work, and your help in navigating the realities of academic
life is hugely appreciated. Mike, you are an incredibly committed individual,
and the fact that you constantly made time for me despite your immensely busy
schedule is hugely appreciated. Thank you in particular for reading and re-reading
this thesis.  I am grateful to both of you for your patience and for
everything you have taught me.

To the other members of the Centre for Cold Matter, I also thank you for making
my time as a PhD student educational and enjoyable. All of you have at some
point (or at many points) both taught and helped me.

Particular thanks goes to Bharath Srivathsan and Kyle Jarvis who worked
directly on the chip experiment with me, suffering many laborious hours in the
cleanroom, and showing me what's what, how's what and especially where's what
in the lab.

The experiment would not exist without Jon Dyne and David Pitman from the CCM
workshop produced many of the parts for the experiment.

Gautam Kambhampati allowed me to hijack his experiment and collaborated with me
on the background-free imaging scheme. He also ensured that I took
regular coffee breaks to maximise lab and office productivity.
%
Steve Etienne and Vj Krishnan from LCN, and Amado Bautista-Salvador from
Hannover were of great help with the microfabrication.
%
I must of course mention Sanja Maricic and Miranda Toora, who have been
unendingly helpful with my various inane requests.

I am grateful to have a wide circle of people to complain to when things have
gone wrong. The bored gamers: Aniq, Cathy, Jason, Jay and Yuki, your incessant
chat kept me sane when locked indoors for weeks at a time. When we were allowed
outside I enjoyed many an evening chatting physics and nonsense in the pub with
my course-mates: Alvise, George, Hailey, Oli, Sam, Simon, Sissi and Will.

Similar services have been provided by Jamie, Jonny, Luke and Sam. It's sad
that we can't spend more time together, but it's always fabulous when we do. To
the other friends, from CCCBC, OURCs and elsewhere, I'm sorry that my choice of
enormous margins has meant that you didn't quite get squeezed onto this page.

The most welcome distraction from studying over the last four years has been
time spent on the river or nearby with coffee. I am grateful to the ladies and
coaches of Thames Rowing Club. You never stop impressing me, and I will miss
yelling at you: yet, I will not miss regularly waking up before five o'clock in the
morning.

Susie, thank you for putting up with me. You always keep me on the right path
(figuratively speaking only) and tolerate my ceaseless rambling with enormous
grace. Your support is beyond measure and you are my favourite human.

Finally, to my parents: I can't thank you enough for everything you have given
me. I love you both.
