Of course I must thank my supervisors. Ben, your limitless patience for me has
been a blessing, whether it be re-aligning the dye laser for the umpteenth time
this week, or putting up with yet another virtual meeting discussing the
tedious details of the latest simulation. It has not gone unappreciated,
although I do not say it enough. Mike, you always made time for me despite how
impossibly busy you always seem to be. Your attention to detail has saved me
from myself more times than I can count, and has made this thesis \cm{better}.
I am enormously grateful to both of you for everything you have taught me.

Other members of the CCM...

%Bharath Srivathsan, who has helped in the design process, and worked
%with me on the fabrication process; Kyle Jarvis, who designed the holding-chip,
%undertook many COMSOL simulations of CPWs.  I must also mention Sanja Maricic
%and Miranda Toora, who have been incredibly patient with my various inane
%requests. Similarly the staff at the London Centre for Nanotechnology have been
%enormously helpful regarding microfabrication, especially Steve Etienne and Vj
%Krishnan.

I am grateful to have a wide circle of people to complain to when things have
gone wrong.  First, the bored gamers: Aniq, Cathy, Jason, Jay and Yuki, whose
incessant banter kept me sane when locked indoors for weeks at a time. When we
were allowed to be together I enjoyed many an evening in the pub with my fellow
members of the Controlled Quantum Dynamics Centre for Doctoral Training:
Alvise, \cm{George}, \cm{Hailey}, Oli, Sam, Sisi, Simon, Will. Similar services
were provided by Jamie, Jonny, Luke and Sam, 

Too much of my time these last four years has been spent at the river, and I am
enormously grateful to the ladies and coaches of Thames Rowing Club. I will
miss you all dearly.

Then Susie, thank you for putting up with me. You keep me going when I am down,
and never stop believing in me. I could not have done this without you.

Finally to my parents. Thank you for everything you have given me, I love you
and
