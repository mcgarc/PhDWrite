Thanks go to all who supported this work: my supervisors Mike Tarbutt and Ben
Sauer; Bharath Srivathsan, who has helped in the design process, and worked
with me on the fabrication process; Kyle Jarvis, who designed the holding-chip,
undertook many COMSOL simulations of CPWs.  I must also mention Sanja Maricic
and Miranda Smith, who have been incredibly patient with my various inane
requests. Similarly the staff at the London Centre for Nanotechnology have been
enormously helpful regarding microfabrication, especially Steve Etienne and Vj
Krishnan.

This report was written from home during the coronoavirus pandemic of 2020, and
would have taken significantly longer without the understanding of my partner
Susannah Smith, who has graciously allowed me to take over our entire dining
table, and supplied me with many a cup of tea to fuel the writing process.
