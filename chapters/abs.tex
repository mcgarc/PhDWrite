%% ESA Abstract (bits)
%Quantum optical systems are promising candidates for use in a vast range of
%technologies, from metrology, to simulation, to probing the fundamentals of
%physics. But despite their high controllability and coherence times, they often
%lack scalability, requiring ungainly optical systems to function.
%
%Chip traps were introduced as a means of miniaturizing such systems. Magnetic
%traps have been formed from fields generated by wires on a substrate and
%external bias fields. This forms a robust trapping environment with very high
%field gradients. Chips are innately scalable due to their fabrication by
%well-understood standard photolithographic methods, and have been routinely
%used for experiments with atoms. Atom chips have proven to be particularly
%useful in formation of Bose-Einstein condensates. They show promise for
%coherent control, and integration with other quantum systems via coupling to
%microwave guides also integrated with the chip.
%
%With the development of new technologies for the creation of ultra-cold
%molecules, realisation of a molecule chip is now a possibility. Rotational
%states of molecules couple strongly to microwave fields, allowing the
%exploitation of cavity QED effects for use in a scalable system which can be
%integrated with other quantum architectures.

%In this report, we present ongoing work into development of a molecule chip
%operating on a magnetically insensitive transition of \CaF{}. In particular, we
%discuss simulations that have allowed us to refine the design of the chip
%trap, and the microfabrication techniques used to build a prototype chip.
%
%Simulations of the trajectories of molecules in magnetic traps have been
%performed. These are used to analyse the trap design, and to ensure that
%loading of molecules is possible through a series of adiabatic transfers
%between magnetic potentials. The phase space acceptance of traps is presented.
%
%The microfabrication of an earlier trap design is presented. Through-mask
%electroplating has been used to construct a chip with trapping wires with
%heights of \SI{3}{\micro\meter}. This is much taller than would be possible
%with conventional photolithography methods, and will allow for high currents to
%be carried on chip, thus forming deep magnetic traps for our molecules.
