I present our efforts to develop a molecule chip: a microfabricated
device for magnetic trapping of ultracold molecules. Such a device could be
used to isolate individual molecules and achieve strong coupling with photons
in a nearby microwave resonator. This would allow for the realisation of a
cavity quantum electrodynamics system, which could be exploited to allow full
control and readout of the molecule state via electrical and microwave
frequency connections. Until recently it has been impossible to generate clouds
of molecules with sufficient phase space density to load such a device, but
recent developments in this field have changed this. Here I will discuss the
design and construction of such an experiment and present simulations informing
the design choices, as well as the details of the microfabrication of the chip
trap, and a scheme for background-free imaging of molecules near the surface.
Finally, I will describe how a microwave resonator could be used to control the
state of a trapped molecule, and describe a scheme for generating non-classical
states in a trapped spin-ensemble.
