I present our efforts to develop a molecule chip: a microfabricated device for
trapping ultracold molecules near a surface and interfacing them with photons
in a microwave resonator. This work is a step towards a cavity quantum
electrodynamics system, where molecular qubits could be coupled and controlled
via microwave photons.

I present the design and construction of a chip capable of trapping ultracold
molecules, together with simulations informing the design choices. I report
the microfabrication processes used to make the chip, characterize the quality
of these processes and describe the design and construction of the apparatus
needed to load molecules onto the chip and detect them.

I also present a scheme for background-free imaging of molecules near the
surface.  Finally, I show how a microwave resonator could be used to control
the state of a trapped molecule, and describe a scheme for generating
non-classical states in a trapped spin-ensemble.
