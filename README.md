# Thesis setup

This should just compile with `pdflatex` or similar command. Some requirements
for various packages (and potential installs on Linux) are written in
`main.tex`.

Figures are now included in the repo. SVGs can be made available upon request.

I've also commited the bibliography, which is setup to run with biber. Run
`pdflatex main.tex` then `biber main` ad nauseum to render.
